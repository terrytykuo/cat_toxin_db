For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Bittersweet is categorized within the Nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes plants like tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. The primary toxic compounds associated with this group in the texts are glycoalkaloids, specifically solanine.\n1. Solanine (Glycoalkaloid)\n1. Name of the compound: Solanine (specifically classified as a glycoalkaloid). Related alkaloids such as solasodine or tomatine may also be present depending on the specific nightshade variety.\n2. Chemical formula: The provided sources do not explicitly state the chemical formula for solanine (Chemically: C\n45\n\t\u200b\n\nH\n73\n\t\u200b\n\nNO\n15\n\t\u200b\n\n).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition: Solanine inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine and overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, causing neurological symptoms like tremors, ataxia (loss of coordination), and seizures.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cytotoxicity: The compound interacts with cell membranes (phospholipids), increasing their permeability and causing cell destruction (cytolysis). This is particularly damaging to the intestinal lining, leading to severe gastrointestinal irritation, inflammation, and hemorrhage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Mitochondrial Impairment: It disrupts cellular energy balance by inhibiting the respiratory chain.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: The sources describe Nightshade plants, including bittersweet, as \"extremely toxic\" to cats.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Concentration: While the sources focus on the green parts of potatoes and tomatoes having the highest concentrations, they note that for the Nightshade group generally, the toxicity can be severe. Ingestion can lead to gastrointestinal distress, neurological confusion, slow heart rate, and dilated pupils. Cats are noted to be more sensitive to these toxins than dogs due to their specific liver metabolism.\nSources:\n\u2022 Eggplant, Tomato, Bell Pepper, and Potato in dogs and cats - PETSVETCHECK1...\n\u2022 Outdoor Plants That Are Toxic to Cats: 10 to Avoid (Vet-Reviewed) - Catster8",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Bittersweet is categorized as a Nightshade plant (likely referring to Solanum dulcamara, Bittersweet Nightshade, rather than American Bittersweet), and is considered extremely toxic to cats. The symptoms reflect the presence of toxic alkaloids (like solanine) found in the Solanaceae family.\n1. Gastrointestinal Distress (Vomiting & Diarrhea)\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Hypersalivation (Drooling).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: 2\u201324 hours (general timeframe for Nightshade/solanine toxicity).\n5. Additional clinical notes: These are often the first signs of poisoning. The plant contains solanine, which is a severe irritant to the gastrointestinal tract and mucous membranes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Neurological Depression\n1. Symptom name: Drowsiness, Depression, Confusion, and Weakness.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological (Central Nervous System).\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: 2\u201324 hours (typically follows or accompanies GI signs).\n5. Additional clinical notes: The toxins affect the central nervous system, leading to significant lethargy and behavioral changes. In severe cases, this can progress to paralysis or coma.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n3. Ocular Abnormalities\n1. Symptom name: Dilated Pupils (Mydriasis).\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Ocular.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: 2\u201324 hours.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Dilated pupils are a hallmark neurological sign of toxicity from plants in the Nightshade family.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n4. Bradycardia\n1. Symptom name: Slow Heart Rate (Bradycardia).\n2. Affected body system: Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: 12\u201324 hours (or as toxicity progresses).\n5. Additional clinical notes: The toxins can disrupt heart rhythm, leading to a dangerously slow heartbeat, which contributes to the classification of this plant as \"extremely toxic.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Bittersweet is categorized within the Nightshade family (Solanaceae), similar to tomatoes and potatoes. Consequently, the recommended veterinary treatments follow the protocols for solanine (glycoalkaloid) poisoning.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting) or Gastric Lavage.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent (typically within 1\u20132 hours) and the cat is not showing severe symptoms, the veterinarian may induce vomiting using medication (such as xylazine for cats) to remove the plant material from the stomach. Alternatively, gastric lavage (stomach pumping) may be performed under anesthesia to wash out the stomach contents.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the primary defense to prevent further toxin absorption. It is only performed if the ingestion is recent and the cat is neurologically stable. Self-medication or inducing vomiting at home is not recommended; immediate veterinary intervention is required.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Toxin Adsorption\n\u2022 Treatment name: Activated Charcoal Administration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of medical-grade activated charcoal (1\u20134 g/kg body weight) into the digestive tract. This substance binds to the unabsorbed solanine toxins in the gut, preventing them from entering the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: In severe poisoning cases, administration may need to be repeated multiple times at 4 to 6-hour intervals because solanine can undergo \"enterohepatic recirculation\" (reabsorption by the body).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n3. Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of crystalloid solutions directly into the vein to rehydrate the cat and maintain electrolyte balance.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This step is essential for two reasons: 1) To compensate for dehydration caused by severe vomiting and diarrhea. 2) To stimulate diuresis (urination), which promotes the excretion of toxins and protects the kidneys, especially if hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) has occurred.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n4. Symptomatic Supportive Care (Medication)\n\u2022 Treatment name: Drug Therapy (Atropine, Anticonvulsants).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Using specific medications to treat life-threatening symptoms. Atropine may be administered to counteract cholinergic symptoms like a dangerously slow heart rate (bradycardia). Benzodiazepines or barbiturates may be used to control seizures.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: There is no specific antidote for solanine poisoning. Treatment focuses on managing severe neurological signs (tremors, seizures) and respiratory distress. Oxygen supplementation or mechanical ventilation may be required in critical cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3"
