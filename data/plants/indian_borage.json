Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Mexican Mint (also known as Indian borage) acts as a gastro-irritant when ingested by cats1.\nHowever, the sources do not explicitly specify which exact parts of the Mexican Mint plant (e.g., leaves, stems, roots, or flowers) contain the toxic principles.\nIn the broader context of the mint family, the sources note that the toxicity generally comes from the essential oils found within the plants, and that even nibbling on fresh leaves can cause stomach upset23. Because the exact toxic parts of Mexican Mint are not singled out, it is safest to consider the entire plant potentially hazardous and keep it out of your cat's reach12.",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Mexican Mint (also known as Indian borage) is specifically classified as a gastro-irritant for cats1.\nHowever, the sources do not isolate the exact specific chemical compound unique to Mexican Mint. Instead, they explain the toxicity in the broader context of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which Mexican Mint belongs to.\nHere is the information available regarding the toxic substances in these plants:\n1. Essential Oils (Plant Oils)\n1. Name of the compound: Essential oils (The sources do not specify the exact essential oil profile for Mexican Mint, but note that mints generally contain toxic oils; related mints contain oils like menthol or pulegone)2....\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: These plant oils act as direct gastro-irritants to the feline digestive tract15. Furthermore, cats lack the specific liver enzymes required to safely process and break down these essential oils6. Because their bodies cannot metabolize the oils, ingestion leads to gastrointestinal upset, resulting in symptoms like vomiting, drooling, and diarrhea24.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency: The sources do not provide the exact concentration of these oils in Mexican Mint1. However, they note a general rule for mint plants: a tiny taste or nibble of fresh leaves typically only causes mild stomach upset, whereas concentrated forms (like extracted essential oils) are highly toxic and can cause severe respiratory distress, liver damage, or neurological issues27.",

Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Mexican Mint (also known as Indian borage) is specifically classified as a gastro-irritant for cats1. Like other plants in the mint family, its toxicity is driven by essential oils that cats lack the necessary liver enzymes to safely metabolize2.\nWhile the sources do not specify exact onset timeframes (e.g., \"within 2 hours\") for mint poisoning, they note that a tiny taste of the fresh plant usually causes mild stomach upset, whereas larger ingestions or exposure to concentrated oils can be much more dangerous3.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingesting or being exposed to Mexican Mint:\n1. Vomiting\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Because Mexican Mint acts directly as a gastro-irritant, vomiting is one of the primary and most common signs of stomach upset after a cat nibbles on the plant1....\n2. Diarrhea\n1. Symptom name: Diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This symptom is a direct result of the plant's essential oils irritating the feline digestive tract as the body attempts to process compounds it cannot properly break down2....\n3. Drooling or Foaming at the Mouth\n1. Symptom name: Drooling (excessive salivation) or foaming at the mouth.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is a localized reaction to the strong taste and irritating nature of the essential oils present in the mint plant34.\n4. Loss of Appetite\n1. Symptom name: Loss of appetite.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: The gastrointestinal irritation, discomfort, and nausea caused by the plant will frequently lead the cat to refuse food45.\n5. Lethargy or Weakness\n1. Symptom name: Lethargy or weakness.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Systemic.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate (can be severe if a large amount is ingested).\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: While a small nibble usually results in mild discomfort, ingesting larger quantities of the plant can cause systemic weakness and lethargy34.\n6. Difficulty Breathing (Associated with Concentrated Exposure)\n1. Symptom name: Difficulty breathing.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: While fresh Mexican Mint leaves generally cause mild gastrointestinal signs, if a cat is exposed to or inhales highly concentrated forms of the plant (such as extracted mint essential oils), it can trigger severe respiratory distress, neurological symptoms, and even liver failure34.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Mexican Mint (Indian borage) acts as a gastro-irritant to cats, and its treatment follows the general veterinary protocols for mint toxicity. While many cases of mild mint ingestion do not require extensive treatment, severe reactions require veterinary intervention12.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests a toxic or highly irritating amount of Mexican Mint, listed in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting), Gastric Lavage, and Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: To prevent the plant material from being fully digested and absorbed, the veterinarian may medically induce vomiting or perform a gastric lavage (pump the stomach)23. Following this, they may administer activated charcoal to bind to and absorb any remaining toxins in the digestive tract3.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: You should never attempt to induce vomiting at home unless explicitly instructed to do so by a veterinary professional, as doing it incorrectly can cause more harm to the cat3. Gastric lavage is generally reserved for more extreme cases of ingestion2.\n2. Fluid Replacement\n1. Treatment name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will administer IV fluids to rehydrate and stabilize the animal23.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because Mexican Mint is a gastro-irritant, it frequently causes vomiting and diarrhea1. This treatment is specifically necessary if these gastrointestinal symptoms have caused the cat to become dehydrated2.\n3. Symptomatic Gastrointestinal Support\n1. Treatment name: Antiemetics and Gastric Protectants.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The vet will administer an anti-nausea injection (antiemetic) to stop the vomiting, as well as gastric protectants or antacids to soothe the irritated stomach lining23.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: The primary goal of this supportive care is to keep the cat as comfortable as possible as the irritants pass through its system2. In severe cases, the cat may need to be hospitalized while receiving these supportive treatments23."
