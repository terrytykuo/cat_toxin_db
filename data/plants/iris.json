Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Iris (Iris species) is considered toxic to cats, primarily due to compounds concentrated in the bulbs (rhizomes). While generally considered less dangerous than \"true lilies\" (which cause kidney failure), Iris ingestion can cause significant tissue irritation and discomfort.\n1. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting, Nausea, and Diarrhea.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate (Sources describe the plant as \"not very toxic\" but capable of causing \"extreme discomfort\").\n4. Typical Onset Time: Not explicitly specified in the provided text (though general plant toxicity symptoms often appear acutely after ingestion).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: These are the most common signs of ingestion. The toxicity is highest in the bulbs, so cats digging up or chewing on rhizomes are at greater risk than those nibbling leaves.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Oral Ulceration and Irritation\n1. Symptom Name: Mouth Ulcers and Oral Irritation.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal / Dermal (Mucous Membranes).\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (upon contact/ingestion).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Ingestion can cause physical damage and chemical irritation to the mouth, leading to visible sores or ulcers. Drooling (hypersalivation) may occur as a reaction to this irritation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,1,3\n3. Dermatitis\n1. Symptom Name: Skin Irritation (Dermatitis).\n2. Affected Body System: Dermal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Not explicitly specified.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Contact with the plant sap or parts can cause irritation to the skin, which is a distinct symptom noted for Irises compared to many other toxic plants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n4. Abdominal Pain\n1. Symptom Name: Abdominal Pain.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Not explicitly specified.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: This pain is likely secondary to the severe gastrointestinal irritation caused by the plant's compounds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3\nImportant Distinction: It is crucial to distinguish Iris from True Lilies (Lilium or Hemerocallis species). While Irises cause \"extreme discomfort\" and gastrointestinal/dermal irritation, they are not noted in the sources to cause the fatal acute renal failure associated with true lilies5,2. However, veterinary attention is still recommended to manage dehydration and pain2.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Iris (Iris species) ingestion in cats typically causes moderate to severe tissue irritation rather than the fatal organ failure associated with \"true lilies,\" but it still requires veterinary intervention to manage dehydration and pain. The bulbs (rhizomes) are the most toxic part12.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is brought in shortly after ingestion, the veterinarian may administer medication to induce vomiting. This expels the plant material from the stomach before the toxins (irritating resinoids and glycosides) are fully absorbed or pass into the intestines34.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is particularly urgent if the cat has ingested the bulb, which contains the highest concentration of toxins and causes the most severe symptoms25. Owners should not attempt to induce vomiting at home, as this can cause injury or aspiration6.\n2. Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) or Subcutaneous Fluid Administration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team administers fluids directly into the bloodstream or under the skin to correct electrolyte imbalances and hydration levels34.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This treatment is critical because Iris ingestion causes symptoms that lead to rapid fluid loss, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea2.... Fluid therapy helps maintain blood pressure and supports the body in clearing the toxins9.\n3. Symptomatic and Oral Care\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Gastroprotectants and Pain Management.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Veterinarians may administer anti-emetics (to stop vomiting), medications to coat the stomach, and analgesics for pain4.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Iris toxicity is distinct for causing mouth ulcers and oral irritation78. Supportive care is necessary to soothe the chemical burns in the mouth and throat that may prevent the cat from eating or drinking comfortably7.\n4. Dermal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Dermal Washing / Bathing.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat has plant sap on its fur or skin, the vet may wash the area with mild soap and water to prevent further absorption or ingestion during grooming10.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Unlike many other toxic plants, the Iris is specifically noted for causing dermatitis (skin irritation) upon contact78. Removing traces of the plant from the coat prevents the cat from re-infecting itself by licking the irritated skin7."
