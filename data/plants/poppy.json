Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the toxins in the Poppy plant directly affect the nervous system. Because there are no specific studies available on poppy toxicity in cats, these symptoms are assumed based on extrapolated data from dogs and other mammals1.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingestion:\n1. Dilated Pupils\n1. Symptom name: Dilated pupils.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological1.\n3. Severity: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is a direct result of the plant's toxins affecting the central nervous system, assumed based on data from other mammals1.\n2. Vomiting\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal / Neurological (the source notes that the nervous system disruption causes the vomiting)1.\n3. Severity: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the sources.\n5.

    "treatments": "\ud83d\udcda Loaded library with 1 notebooks\n\u26a0\ufe0f Browser state is 9.8 days old, may need re-authentication\n\ud83d\udcac Asking: What are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests Poppy?

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, there is no specific, unique veterinary treatment protocol outlined exclusively for Poppy ingestion in cats. However, because poppies are known to affect the central nervous system\u2014causing symptoms such as dilated pupils, vomiting, lack of coordination, and collapse1\u2014veterinarians generally follow standard emergency protocols for toxic plant ingestion and neurotoxin exposure23.\nIf your cat ingests a Poppy, the recommended general veterinary treatments, in order of priority, include:\n1. Immediate Veterinary Assessment\n1. Treatment name: Veterinary Consultation and Triage.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center immediately for tailored guidance, letting them know exactly what type of plant the cat was exposed to4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: You should act quickly and not wait for clinical signs of poisoning (such as vomiting or lack of coordination) to appear before seeking professional help4.\n2. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Emesis Induction, Gastric Lavage, and Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: To prevent the plant material from being fully digested and absorbed into the bloodstream, a veterinarian may medically induce vomiting or perform a gastric lavage (stomach pump)3. This is often followed by administering doses of activated charcoal to bind and neutralize any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract2.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: You should never attempt to induce vomiting at home unless specifically instructed to do so by a veterinary professional, as doing it incorrectly can cause severe harm56. Furthermore, if the cat is already showing severe neurological signs like collapse1, the vet may need to bypass inducing vomiting and go straight to a stomach pump to prevent the cat from accidentally inhaling its vomit2.\n3. Systemic and Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy and Symptomatic Medication.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The cat will likely need to be hospitalized so the veterinary team can administer IV fluids to treat dehydration from vomiting, stabilize the animal, and help flush the toxins from the system37. The vet may also administer anti-nausea injections (antiemetics) and stomach-protecting medications37.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because poppy toxicity targets the nervous system and causes incoordination and collapse1, the cat will need to be kept as comfortable as possible in a safe, confined space at the clinic to prevent self-injury while the neurological effects of the toxin slowly wear off38."
