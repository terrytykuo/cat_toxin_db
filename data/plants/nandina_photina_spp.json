Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the seeds (within the fruit) and the leaves of the Photina Red Leaf (Nandina Photina spp.) are the toxic parts of the plant12.\nThese parts contain cyanogenic glycosides, which are converted into highly toxic cyanide when a cat chews or grinds the leaves or seeds1. If a seed is swallowed completely whole without being chewed, the cyanide is typically not released, and toxicity is not expected1.",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the toxic substances in the Photina Red Leaf (Nandina Photina spp.) are cyanogenic glycosides. Here are the details regarding this toxin:\n1. Cyanogenic Glycosides (Hydrogen Cyanide)\n1. Name of the compound: Cyanogenic glycosides, which break down to release hydrogen cyanide when the plant material is chewed or digested1....\n2. Chemical formula: Hydrogen cyanide is HCN1.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: When a cat chews or grinds the plant's seeds or leaves, it compromises the plant tissue and triggers the conversion of cyanogenic glycosides into cyanide2. Once in the body, the cyanide binds to ferric (Fe3+) iron, specifically targeting an enzyme in the mitochondria called cytochrome c oxidase24. This disrupts the electron transport chain and completely prevents the cat's cells from utilizing oxygen to generate energy24. This halt in cellular respiration rapidly leads to severe tissue hypoxia (oxygen starvation) and cell death24.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The toxins are primarily housed within the leaves and the seeds (within the fruit) of the plant2. The physical integrity of the seed is critical to its potency: if a cat swallows a seed completely whole without crushing or chewing it, the cyanide is not released, and toxicity is not expected2. While severe toxicity is uncommon unless large amounts are ingested, cyanide is incredibly potent and fast-acting; if a toxic dose is chewed and absorbed, the onset of life-threatening clinical signs develops very rapidly, often within 10 to 60 minutes25.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Photina Red Leaf (Nandina Photina spp.) contains cyanogenic glycosides, which release highly toxic hydrogen cyanide when the plant material is chewed and digested12. Because cyanide halts cellular respiration and deprives the body's tissues of oxygen, clinical signs are extremely acute and severe.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingesting a toxic dose of Photina Red Leaf:\n1. Gastrointestinal Distress and Distinctive Breath\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive drooling, and almond-flavored breath23.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapidly, often within 10 to 60 minutes2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: While vomiting and drooling are common early signs of many plant poisonings, the presence of an almond-like odor on the breath is a specific and classic indicator of cyanide gas release2.\n2. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom name: Tachypnea (rapid breathing), severe respiratory distress, panting, and gasping for breath23.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapidly, often within 10 to 60 minutes2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is a direct result of tissue hypoxia. The cyanide prevents the cat's cells from utilizing oxygen, causing the respiratory system to go into overdrive in a futile attempt to oxygenate the body23.\n3. Mucous Membrane Discoloration and Cardiovascular Shock\n1. Symptom name: Unusually bright red or pink gums (brick red mucous membranes), hypotension (low blood pressure), and cardiac arrhythmias23.\n2. Affected body system: Hematological and Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapidly, often within 10 to 60 minutes2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: A classic sign of cyanide toxicosis is cherry-red blood coloring2. Because the cells cannot absorb oxygen from the blood, the oxygen remains trapped in the bloodstream, turning the cat's gums an unusual, bright cherry or brick red23. In some cases, cyanosis (blue discoloration) may also occur as shock sets in2.\n4. Severe Neurological Impairment\n1. Symptom name: Dilated pupils, sudden collapse, muscle seizures, convulsions, coma, and death23.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapidly, often within 10 to 60 minutes2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: The brain is highly sensitive to oxygen deprivation. As cellular energy production completely halts, profound neurological collapse occurs. Cyanide toxicity is incredibly fast-acting, and sudden death frequently occurs before veterinary treatment can even be initiated2.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Cyanide Antidote Administration\n1. Treatment name: Antidote Therapy (Sodium Nitrite and Sodium Thiosulfate, OR Hydroxycobalamin).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: To counteract the cyanide released by the plant, the veterinarian may administer specific antidotes. One method uses sodium nitrite to combine with cyanide and form cyanomethemoglobin, followed by sodium thiosulfate to convert it into water-soluble thiocyanate, which the cat can safely excrete in its urine1. Alternatively, the vet may use hydroxycobalamin, which binds with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) that is also excreted in the urine1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is the most critical and urgent intervention for severe poisoning, as cyanide toxicity causes rapid cellular hypoxia (oxygen starvation) and death can often occur before treatment even begins12. In less severe cases, the veterinarian may opt to treat the cat using only sodium thiosulfate1.\n2. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Emesis Induction (Inducing Vomiting) and Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: To prevent the plant material from further breaking down and releasing cyanide into the bloodstream, the veterinarian will medically induce vomiting to empty the stomach. This is followed by administering a dose of activated charcoal combined with a cathartic to bind and pass any remaining toxins out of the gastrointestinal tract1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This procedure is strictly indicated for asymptomatic cats following a known or suspected large ingestion of the plant1.\n3. Acidosis Correction and Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: Venous Blood Gas Monitoring and Sodium Bicarbonate.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team will routinely monitor the cat's metabolic state using venous blood gas testing. If severe metabolic acidosis is detected, the veterinarian will correct it by administering sodium bicarbonate1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: While large ingestions require intensive emergency intervention, most minor exposures to cyanogenic plants in small animals only require minimal gastrointestinal supportive care if managed promptly1. Obtaining a whole blood cyanide level can also be helpful for the veterinarian to confirm the diagnosis and guide ongoing care1."
