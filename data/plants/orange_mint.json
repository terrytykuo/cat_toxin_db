(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the leaves and the entire plant of Orange Mint are considered unsafe for cats1....\nThe toxicity of Orange Mint comes from the essential oils contained within the plant2. Chewing or nibbling on fresh mint leaves exposes the cat to these oils, which their livers lack the enzymes to properly process, leading to stomach upset34.\nAdditionally, any highly concentrated forms derived from the plant (such as extracted essential oils) are extremely dangerous and can cause severe toxicity through ingestion, inhalation, or even direct skin exposure5.",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Orange Mint (along with other toxic mint varieties) harms cats due to the presence of specific plant oils. Here are the details regarding the toxic compounds:\n1. Essential Oils (Specifically Menthol and related compounds)\n1. Name of the compound: Essential oils, which in mint plants primarily include compounds like menthol (and sometimes pulegone)12.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Cats lack the specific liver enzymes required to effectively break down and process these plant-based essential oils3. Because a cat's body cannot properly metabolize them, the oils act as severe irritants to the gastrointestinal tract, causing vomiting and diarrhea4. If absorbed in larger amounts or inhaled, these volatile oils can depress the central nervous system, cause respiratory distress, and place dangerous stress on the liver, potentially leading to liver damage3....\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The level of danger is directly tied to the concentration of these oils. Nibbling on fresh Orange Mint leaves generally results in mild stomach upset or irritation78. However, highly concentrated forms, such as extracted mint essential oils, are exceptionally potent and dangerous. Exposure to concentrated oils\u2014whether ingested, inhaled from a diffuser, or absorbed through the skin\u2014can quickly cause severe, life-threatening toxicity and neurological issues59.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Orange Mint is unsafe for cats because it contains toxic essential oils1. When a cat ingests or is exposed to toxic mint plants or their concentrated essential oils, they cannot properly metabolize the compounds due to a lack of specific liver enzymes2.\nWhile the sources do not provide an exact hourly onset timeframe specific to mint poisoning, symptoms generally appear rapidly after exposure to essential oils, with liver complications developing later. Here are the symptoms a cat may exhibit:\n1. Gastrointestinal Upset (Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Drooling)\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive drooling (foaming at the mouth), difficulty swallowing, and loss of appetite3....\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate (from a small nibble of the plant) up to Severe (if concentrated oils are ingested)67.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapidly shortly after ingestion8.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: A tiny taste of the fresh plant usually results in mild stomach upset. However, if the cat consumes larger amounts or is exposed to concentrated essential oils, the gastrointestinal distress becomes far more dangerous6.\n2. Neurological Impairment\n1. Symptom name: Lethargy, profound weakness, uncoordinated gait (ataxia), muscle tremors, and seizures5.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological35.\n3. Severity: Severe3.\n4. Typical onset time: Shortly after absorption into the bloodstream.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: These severe neurological signs are most often triggered by exposure to the highly concentrated essential oils found in the plant, rather than just a casual nibble of a leaf36.\n3. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom name: Difficulty breathing, coughing, and sneezing35.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory5.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe3.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate (if oils are inhaled) to shortly after exposure6.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Strong mint aromas and essential oils can heavily irritate a cat's sensitive respiratory system. This can occur not only from ingestion but also from simply inhaling the diffused oils from the plant69.\n4. Liver Damage / Failure\n1. Symptom name: Liver damage progressing to liver failure13.\n2. Affected body system: Hepatic2.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal310.\n4. Typical onset time: Delayed (often developing over several hours or days as the liver struggles to metabolize the toxins).\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Because a cat's liver lacks the specific enzymes necessary to break down plant essential oils, the toxins build up and place dangerous, potentially fatal stress on the liver2.\n5. Dermal and Mucous Membrane Burns\n1. Symptom name: Skin irritation, redness, or burns on the lips, gums, tongue, or skin5.\n2. Affected body system: Dermal and Mucous Membranes5.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate upon direct contact.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This localized irritation occurs when the cat's skin or mouth comes into direct physical contact with the plant's irritating oils or sap5.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Orange Mint contains toxic essential oils that can harm cats1. While a small nibble of a mint plant often only causes mild stomach upset that may not require treatment, the ingestion of large amounts or concentrated essential oils can lead to severe reactions requiring immediate veterinary intervention23.\nIf treatment is necessary, veterinarians typically recommend the following procedures, prioritized from most urgent (decontamination) to ongoing supportive care:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting), Gastric Lavage, and Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: To prevent the mint's essential oils and plant material from being fully digested and absorbed into the bloodstream, the veterinarian may medically induce vomiting or perform a gastric lavage (pump the stomach)23. Following the removal of stomach contents, the vet may administer activated charcoal to bind to and absorb any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract3.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Inducing vomiting should never be attempted at home; it must be done strictly under veterinary supervision, as doing it incorrectly can cause further harm3. A gastric lavage is generally reserved for more extreme cases of ingestion2.\n2. Fluid Therapy and Stabilization\n1. Treatment name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian administers IV fluids to the cat to restore hydration, flush toxins from the body, and stabilize the animal23.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is an especially critical supportive care step if the cat has become severely dehydrated due to the excessive vomiting and diarrhea caused by the mint's essential oils2. In severe cases, the cat will need to be hospitalized during this fluid therapy to allow for continuous monitoring23.\n3. Targeted Symptomatic Medication\n1. Treatment name: Anti-nausea Injections and Gastric Protectants (Antacids).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The vet administers specific medications to alleviate the cat's gastrointestinal distress, such as anti-nausea injections to stop vomiting and antacids or gastric protectants to soothe and shield the stomach lining23.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: These medications are used to keep the cat as comfortable as possible during the illness and assist the gastrointestinal tract in recovering from the irritating effects of the plant's essential oils23."
