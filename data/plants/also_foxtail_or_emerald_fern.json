What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, here is the information regarding the Asparagus Fern (also known as the Foxtail Fern or Emerald Fern):\n1. Botanical Family: The provided sources do not explicitly state the botanical family for the Asparagus Fern. One source categorizes it under \"Ferns\" in a table comparing toxic and safe plants, though it notes it should be distinguished from non-toxic ferns like the Boston Fern1.\n2. Brief Description:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Appearance: The plant is described as hardy and is characterized by its feathery leaves2. It also produces berries2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Habitat & Location: It is commonly found in homes as a houseplant and is often used in hanging pots due to its foliage2.\nNote: While the prompt asks for the botanical family, the sources primarily focus on the plant's common names and toxicity rather than its taxonomy.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Asparagus Fern (also known as the Emerald Fern or Foxtail Fern) primarily causes skin irritation (dermatitis) upon contact and gastrointestinal upset (vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea) if the berries are ingested.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments listed in order of priority:\n1. Dermal Decontamination (Bathing)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Since the foliage causes allergic dermatitis, the veterinarian or owner (under guidance) should bathe the cat using lukewarm water and a mild liquid dish soap to remove the irritating sap or plant material from the skin and fur.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the primary treatment for the skin irritation caused by brushing against the fern. It prevents further absorption and stops the cat from ingesting the toxin while grooming.\n\u2022 Sources:1,2\n2. Gastrointestinal Decontamination (Emesis & Activated Charcoal)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat has ingested the berries (which contain the GI toxin), the veterinarian may induce vomiting (emesis) using prescription medications to remove the berries from the stomach. This may be followed by the administration of activated charcoal to bind any remaining toxins.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This step is taken if the ingestion was recent. Owners are advised not to induce vomiting at home (e.g., with hydrogen peroxide) as it can cause severe complications; this should be done in a clinic.\n\u2022 Sources:3,2\n3. Supportive Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of subcutaneous or intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is used if the cat has lost significant fluids due to the vomiting and diarrhea associated with berry ingestion.\n\u2022 Sources:4,5\n4. Symptomatic Medication (Antiemetics & Gastroprotectants)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of medications to stop vomiting (antiemetics), soothe the stomach lining (gastroprotectants), and manage diarrhea.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Used to make the cat comfortable and prevent further fluid loss while the toxins pass through the system. A bland diet may also be prescribed for a few days to settle the stomach.\n\u2022 Sources:5,2"
