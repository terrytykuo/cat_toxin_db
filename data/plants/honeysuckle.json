(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the toxicity of Honeysuckle (Lonicera species) to cats appears to depend on the specific variety, and the information varies by source regarding which parts are harmful.\n\u2022 General Toxicity: One source lists Honeysuckle generally as a plant that is poisonous to cats. It notes that the flowers have a sweet smell that can be tempting to cats, implying the plant poses a risk if accessible, though it does not explicitly isolate specific parts (like berries or leaves) as the sole source of toxicity in this context1.\n\u2022 Safe Varieties: In contrast, another source identifies Tatarian honeysuckle (Lonicera tatarica) as a safe alternative to catnip, often used in cat toys or as a loose herb to provide a euphoric reaction2. Additionally, Honeysuckle Fuchsia is listed as a non-toxic plant for cats3.\nImportant Note: Because different species of honeysuckle have different toxicity profiles (ranging from safe to poisonous), and the general \"Honeysuckle\" is flagged as toxic in safety guides, it is crucial to correctly identify the specific species before allowing a cat access.\nSources:\n\u2022 25 Common Plants Poisonous to Cats | ASPCA Pet Health Insurance1\n\u2022 Mint and Cats: Toxicity Concerns2\n\u2022 Plants non-toxic to cats3",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the toxicity of Honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.) is complex: general \"Honeysuckle\" is listed as a poisonous plant to cats1, but specific varieties like Tatarian honeysuckle (Lonicera tatarica) are considered safe and even used as catnip alternatives2.\nIf a cat ingests a toxic variety of Honeysuckle, veterinary treatment follows standard protocols for plant poisoning, as specific antidotes are not mentioned.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent, the veterinarian may administer medication to induce vomiting. This removes the plant material from the stomach before the toxins can be fully absorbed into the system3.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is time-sensitive and generally most effective if performed shortly after ingestion. Owners should not attempt to induce vomiting at home without professional instruction, as it can risk injury to the cat4.\n2. Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) or Subcutaneous Fluid Administration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian administers fluids directly into the bloodstream or under the skin. This therapy helps to correct dehydration caused by vomiting or diarrhea and assists the body in flushing toxins out through the kidneys3.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is a standard supportive treatment for cats showing signs of poisoning to maintain blood pressure and organ function while the body processes the toxin3.\n3. Symptomatic Care and Monitoring\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Supportive Medical Management.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team monitors the cat\u2019s vital signs, including heart rate and hydration levels. They may administer medications to control specific symptoms, such as anti-emetics to stop vomiting or gastroprotectants to soothe the stomach3.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because symptoms of plant poisoning can range from a \"minor tummy ache\" to more severe reactions, the vet will tailor care to the specific signs the cat is exhibiting (e.g., inflammation around the mouth, dilated pupils, or difficulty breathing)3....\nImportant Note on Species: It is worth verifying the specific type of Honeysuckle. Tatarian honeysuckle (Lonicera tatarica) is listed as a safe alternative to catnip and produces a similar euphoric behavioral reaction, often found in cat toys2. However, general garden Honeysuckle appears on toxic plant lists, so treating ingestion as a potential poisoning until confirmed otherwise is the safest course of action1."
