List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Ficus Audrey (Ficus benghalensis) contains a milky sap with proteolytic enzymes (ficin) and psoralens that cause mild to moderate irritation. Treatment focuses primarily on removing the sap and managing local irritation.\nHere are the recommended treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Oral and Dermal)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: This involves immediately wiping away any visible sap from the cat's mouth or fur. If the sap is on the skin or fur, the cat should be bathed or rinsed using liquid dish soap and lukewarm water to prevent the cat from grooming it off and re-ingesting it. The mouth should be rinsed with water to dilute the irritants.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Ficus Audrey sap can cause dermatitis (skin irritation) upon contact, so wearing gloves while cleaning the cat is advisable. Do not attempt to induce vomiting at home, as this can cause further injury; specific decontamination usually stops at rinsing unless a massive amount was ingested.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4\n2. Dilution and Soothing\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Offer the cat water, or occasionally a small amount of milk or yogurt, to help soothe the oral cavity and dilute any remaining sap in the mouth and throat.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This step helps alleviate the immediate burning sensation or oral irritation caused by the enzymes in the sap. It is noted specifically for plants causing oral pain that something cool like yogurt can help soothe the mouth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n3. Symptomatic Supportive Care\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea persist, a veterinarian may administer anti-emetics (to stop vomiting), gastroprotectants, and fluid therapy to maintain hydration.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Ficus Audrey toxicity is generally considered mild, and symptoms often resolve after the initial irritation subsides. Veterinary intervention with medication is usually reserved for cases where the cat appears very uncomfortable, or if vomiting does not resolve on its own.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4"
