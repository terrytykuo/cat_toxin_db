Severity: Mild to Moderate (can be severe depending on the amount ingested).\n4. Typical Onset Time: Not explicitly stated in the sources, though clinical signs of plant irritants typically appear acutely (often within hours).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The plant contains saponins which irritate the digestive tract. In cats specifically, the vomiting may occasionally contain blood, a symptom noted particularly for the Dragon Tree (Dracaena marginata) and Corn Plant (Dracaena fragrans).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2.

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the toxicity of Dracaena (Dracaena spp.) is generally considered mild to moderate and often self-limiting. However, veterinary intervention may be necessary if a cat consumes a large amount or exhibits severe symptoms.\nHere are the recommended treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Removal of Plant Material)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Immediate removal of any remaining plant fragments from the cat's mouth. This may involve wiping out the mouth to ensure no residue remains that could continue to release toxins.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the first step to prevent further ingestion and irritation. It is recommended for all Dracaena species, including the Dragon Tree (Dracaena marginata) and Corn Plant (Dracaena fragrans).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Fluid Therapy and Electrolyte Correction\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Veterinary administration of fluids to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances resulting from vomiting and diarrhea.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the primary specific treatment listed in veterinary toxicology resources for Dracaena ingestion, as the plant's saponins can cause significant gastrointestinal irritation leading to fluid loss.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:3\n3. Dilution\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Offering the cat a small amount of water or milk to dilute the stomach contents.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This step is specifically noted for the Dragon Tree (Dracaena marginata) to help reduce gastric irritation. General advice for Dracaena species also includes encouraging hydration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n4. Symptomatic Medication\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Administration of medications to alleviate specific clinical signs, such as anti-emetics to stop vomiting.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Dracaena toxicity is generally \"self-limiting,\" meaning it often resolves on its own. However, medication is recommended if the cat has consumed a \"large amount,\" is very weak, refuses to eat, or if symptoms are persistent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:2"
