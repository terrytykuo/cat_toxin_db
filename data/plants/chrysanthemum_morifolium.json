Pyrethrins\n1. Name of the compound: Pyrethrins (These are natural insecticides derived from the chrysanthemum flower).\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Nervous System: Pyrethrins affect the nervous system, leading to signs such as incoordination (ataxia) and weakness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Irritation: They cause direct irritation to the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sensitivity: Sources note that while pyrethrins are used in some dog flea and tick medications, cats are significantly more sensitive to them than dogs, making ingestion dangerous.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Toxicity Level: The plant is generally considered mildly to moderately toxic.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Comparative Potency: While the natural concentration in the plant causes illness, it is the same class of compound that can be highly toxic in concentrated pesticide forms.\nSources:1,2,3,4,5,6\n2. Lactones\n1. Name of the compound: Lactones (specifically identified as sesquiterpene lactones in some contexts, or simply lactones).\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Irritation: These compounds act as irritants to the gastrointestinal tract and can also affect the nervous system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Clinical Effect: Ingestion leads to vomiting, diarrhea, and increased salivation (hypersalivation).\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 General: These contribute to the overall mild-to-moderate toxicity profile of the plant.\nSources:1,2\n3. Sesquiterpenes\n1.

Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Irritation: These compounds work in conjunction with lactones and pyrethrins to cause physical irritation to the mouth and digestive system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Dermatitis: Contact with these compounds can also cause skin irritation (dermatitis) in the mouth or on the skin.\n4.

The plant contains pyrethrins, sesquiterpene lactones, and other irritants that primarily affect the gastrointestinal system and, in some cases, the nervous system.\n1. Vomiting\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources, but gastrointestinal irritation from plant ingestion typically manifests within a few hours.\n5. Additional clinical notes: This is one of the most common signs of ingestion. The plant contains lactones and other irritants that inflame the stomach lining.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4,5,6\n2. Diarrhea\n1. Symptom name: Diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Often accompanies vomiting as a result of the plant's irritating properties passing through the intestinal tract.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4,5\n3. Incoordination (Ataxia)\n1. Symptom name: Incoordination (wobbly gait or stumbling).\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified.\n5. Additional clinical notes: This symptom is linked to pyrethrins, a natural insecticide found in the plant. While these compounds are used in some flea medications, cats are particularly sensitive to them, and ingestion can affect the nervous system causing unsteadiness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,6,7\n4. Excessive Drooling (Hypersalivation)\n1. Symptom name: Increased salivation (Ptyalism).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal / Neurological.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified.\n5. Additional clinical notes: This can be a direct response to the bitter taste of the plant or a sign of nausea and oral irritation caused by the toxic compounds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1\n5. Loss of Appetite (Anorexia)\n1. Symptom name: Inappetence (Refusal to eat).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified.\n5.

Symptom name: Dermatitis (Skin irritation).\n2. Affected body system: Dermal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified.\n5. Additional clinical notes: While less commonly highlighted than GI symptoms for ingestion, contact with the plant can sometimes cause skin irritation or rashes due to its chemical properties.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:8 (Noted generally for \"Pom flowers,\" a category including chrysanthemums).",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Chrysanthemums (Mums) are considered mildly to moderately toxic to cats. They contain pyrethrins, sesquiterpene lactones, and other irritants that affect the gastrointestinal and nervous systems.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting) and Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent (typically within 1\u20132 hours), the veterinarian may administer medication (such as xylazine or apomorphine) to induce vomiting and remove the plant material from the stomach. This is often followed by the administration of activated charcoal, which binds to the remaining toxins in the gut to prevent absorption into the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Do not attempt to induce vomiting at home (e.g., with hydrogen peroxide) unless explicitly instructed by a professional, as it can cause severe irritation or aspiration. Decontamination is most effective when performed shortly after ingestion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4\n2. Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) or Subcutaneous Fluid Administration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of electrolyte-balanced fluids to correct dehydration and support kidney function.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is critical if the cat has been experiencing profuse vomiting or diarrhea, which are the most common symptoms of Chrysanthemum poisoning. Fluids help flush toxins from the body and maintain blood pressure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:5,6,4\n3. Symptomatic Pharmacological Support\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Anti-emetics and Gastroprotectants.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may administer anti-emetics (to stop vomiting) and gastroprotectants (to coat and soothe the stomach lining). In cases of incoordination or neurological distress, muscle relaxants or other medications may be used.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because Chrysanthemums contain irritants that inflame the stomach and intestines, these medications keep the cat comfortable and prevent further fluid loss while the irritation heals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:5,7,4\n4. Dermal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Bathing / Washing.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Washing the cat with a mild liquid dish soap (like Dawn) and lukewarm water to remove plant sap, pollen, or oils from the fur and skin.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Chrysanthemums can cause dermatitis (skin irritation) upon contact. Furthermore, cats are meticulous groomers; if pyrethrin-containing oils or sap remain on the fur, the cat may re-ingest the toxins while grooming, prolonging the symptoms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:8,9"
