For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, here are the details regarding the toxic compounds found in Monstera plants (Monstera deliciosa and Monstera adansonii) that are harmful to cats:\n1. Insoluble Calcium Oxalate Crystals (Raphides)\n1. Name of the compound: Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (specifically in the form of needle-like crystals known as raphides)1....\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: These needle-like crystals are bundled inside specialized plant cells known as idioblasts34. When a cat bites, chews, or crushes the plant material, these cells are ruptured and the sharp crystals are forcefully ejected into the cat's oral mucosa and surrounding tissues34. Instead of a systemic chemical poisoning, this acts as a severe mechanical irritant, causing immediate physical trauma, intense pain, and inflammation to the mouth, tongue, throat, and gastrointestinal tract1....\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: These crystals are distributed throughout all parts of the Monstera plant, and the toxicity is generally classified as \"moderate\"12. Because the intense burning and pain are immediate upon chewing, it typically stops the cat from consuming a large amount of the plant35. Consequently, ingestion is rarely fatal, though in severe cases, the resulting inflammatory swelling in the mouth and throat can be dangerous and potentially obstruct the cat's airway34.",

Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingesting or being exposed to Monstera plants (Monstera deliciosa and Monstera adansonii):\n1. Intense Oral Pain and Irritation\n1. Symptom name: Intense burning and irritation of the mouth, accompanied by crying out in pain1....\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (oral cavity)3.\n3. Severity: Moderate12.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate (upon chewing or biting)3.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This immediate pain is caused mechanically rather than chemically. When the cat bites the plant, specialized cells forcefully eject needle-like, insoluble calcium oxalate crystals directly into the cat's oral mucosa3.\n2. Drooling (Hypersalivation)\n1. Symptom name: Excessive drooling or hypersalivation1....\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal3.\n3. Severity: Moderate12.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate (upon chewing or biting)3.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is a localized reaction to the physical trauma and intense burning sensation occurring in the mouth3.\n3. Swelling of the Mouth and Throat\n1. Symptom name: Swelling of the mouth and tongue, leading to difficulty swallowing1....\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal and Respiratory (if the airway becomes obstructed)3.\n3. Severity: Moderate to severe1....\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate3.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: The trauma from the calcium oxalate crystals causes an inflammatory response in the tissues3. While Monstera ingestion is rarely fatal, in severe cases, the swelling in the mouth and throat can become significant enough to obstruct the cat's airway3.\n4. Vomiting\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting12.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal3.\n3. Severity: Moderate12.\n4. Typical onset time: Shortly after ingestion (typically follows the initial oral irritation if swallowed).\n5. Any additional clinical notes: If the cat manages to swallow the plant material despite the immediate mouth pain, the sharp crystals will continue to severely irritate the rest of the gastrointestinal tract, triggering vomiting3.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Monstera plants (including Monstera deliciosa and Monstera adansonii) contain insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides) that cause immediate, intense mechanical irritation and pain to a cat's mouth and gastrointestinal tract1.... Because these crystals do not cause systemic organ damage, treatment is focused entirely on managing the physical trauma and resulting symptoms4.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests Monstera, listed in order of urgency:\n1. Airway Management and Oxygen Support\n1. Treatment name: Airway Management and Oxygen Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will act quickly to secure an open airway for the cat to breathe and may administer supplemental oxygen4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is the most urgent, life-saving intervention, but it is typically only necessary in rare, severe cases45. It is required if the physical trauma from the sharp calcium oxalate crystals triggers an extreme inflammatory response, causing the cat's mouth, tongue, and throat (laryngeal edema) to swell enough to obstruct their airway1....\n2. Oral Decontamination and Rinsing\n1. Treatment name: Oral Decontamination, Rinsing, and Calcium Binding.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Any remaining plant material is physically removed from the cat's mouth, and the oral cavity is thoroughly rinsed or wiped out with cool water1.... Additionally, the vet (or the owner at home) may offer a small amount of milk, yogurt, or other calcium-containing dairy products; the calcium binds to the insoluble oxalate crystals, which helps clear them from the mouth and esophagus while soothing the irritation46.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is the immediate first line of defense to stop the intense burning and pain4. Most cases of Monstera exposure have an excellent prognosis and resolve fully with this simple decontamination, often without needing further veterinary intervention4.\n3. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: Pain Relief and Anti-Nausea Medication (Antiemetics).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will administer specific medications to relieve the intense oral and gastrointestinal pain, as well as anti-nausea drugs to stop ongoing vomiting27.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This supportive medical care is recommended if the cat remains highly distressed, experiences significant ongoing symptoms, or refuses to eat and drink after a short time due to the lingering pain12."
