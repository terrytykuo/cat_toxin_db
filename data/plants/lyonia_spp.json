List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Fetterbush (also known as Staggerbush or Lyonia spp.) contains grayanotoxins. These are the same potent toxins found in Rhododendrons and Azaleas. Veterinary treatment focuses on decontamination and managing the cardiovascular and neurological effects caused by the toxin's disruption of sodium channels.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Emesis and Activated Charcoal)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Gastrointestinal Decontamination.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is neurologically stable (alert and not seizing), the veterinarian will induce vomiting (emesis) to remove the plant material from the stomach. This is followed by the administration of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and speed their removal.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Sources note that grayanotoxin-containing plant material often remains in the stomach for many hours, meaning inducing vomiting can be successful even several hours after ingestion. However, this should only be done if the cat is not showing severe neurological signs like seizures or coma to prevent aspiration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Cardiovascular Support (Fluids and Atropine)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Fluid Therapy and Cardiac Medications.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Intravenous (IV) fluids are administered to support blood pressure, as hypotension (low blood pressure) is a common symptom. If the cat is experiencing severe bradycardia (slow heart rate), the veterinarian will administer atropine.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Grayanotoxins can cause significant cardiovascular collapse. While atropine addresses the slow heart rate, other anti-arrhythmic drugs like lidocaine or procainamide may be required if the cat develops irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Continuous heart rate and blood pressure monitoring is essential until the patient is discharged.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n3. Neurological Management\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Seizure and Tremor Control.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat exhibits tremors or seizures due to the toxin's effect on nerve cells, veterinarians use specific medications to control them. Methocarbamol is recommended for tremors, while standard anticonvulsants are used for seizures.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: The toxin prevents sodium channels in cells from closing, leading to prolonged excitation of nerve and muscle cells. This can manifest as weakness, tremors, or convulsions, which must be controlled to prevent secondary damage (like hyperthermia).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,2\n4. Symptomatic Supportive Care\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Gastrointestinal and Respiratory Support.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: This includes the administration of anti-emetics to stop persistent vomiting and gastroprotectants to soothe the stomach. If the cat has inhaled vomit, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat or prevent aspiration pneumonia.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Mild cases may only result in GI upset (vomiting/diarrhea) and CNS depression. These cases generally have an excellent prognosis with supportive care. However, because vomiting is a prominent symptom, the risk of aspiration pneumonia is noted as a specific concern for grayanotoxin poisoning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2"
