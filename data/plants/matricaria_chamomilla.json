(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the flowers of the Chamomile plant are specifically identified as potentially toxic to cats.\n\u2022 Toxic Parts: The sources explicitly state that Chamomile flowers are not safe for cats. While often used in tea for humans, consumption by cats\u2014particularly in large amounts at once or over an extended period\u2014can lead to poisoning1.\n\u2022 Toxic Extracts: Chamomile oil is mentioned as an essential oil that is \"considered safe\" for cats to be around (in contrast to highly toxic oils like Tea Tree or Wintergreen), but sources emphasize that cats should never ingest the oil2.\n\u2022 Note on Dosage: There is some nuance in the sources regarding toxicity. One source suggests that Chamomile in \"small doses\" can be a safer, calming alternative to Lavender, but advises consulting a veterinarian before use3. However, the specific entry regarding the flowers warns that they can cause vomiting and diarrhea1.\nSources:\n\u2022 What Houseplants and Flowers Are Safe for Cats? | Purina US1\n\u2022 Is Lavender Safe For Cats? | Dutch2\n\u2022 Is Lavender Poisonous to Cats? | La Belle Fleur3",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the specific chemical compounds responsible for Chamomile's toxicity in cats are not explicitly named (unlike plants such as Lilies or Sago Palm where specific toxins are cited). However, the sources provide the following details regarding its harmful components:\n1. Chamomile Flowers\n1. Name of the compound: The sources do not identify the specific chemical toxin, but explicitly state that Chamomile flowers are the part of the plant that is unsafe for cats1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Ingestion of the flowers affects the gastrointestinal tract. While the plant has calming effects on humans (e.g., in tea), in cats, consumption leads to vomiting and diarrhea1.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 High Dose/Cumulative Risk: Toxicity is linked to quantity. Poisoning typically occurs if a cat consumes large amounts at once or ingests the plant over a long period of time1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Low Dose Nuance: There is conflicting information regarding lower concentrations. One source lists Chamomile oil as an essential oil considered \"safe\" for cats2, and another suggests that small doses of Chamomile can be a soothing, cat-safe alternative to Lavender3. However, the consumption of the flowers themselves is expressly warned against for causing illness1.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, particularly regarding Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), the plant is generally considered safe in small doses or specific forms (like oil in diffusers) but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities.\n1. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting and Diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate (Toxicity is typically linked to consuming large amounts at once or over a long period).\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the provided sources.\n5. Additional clinical notes: While Chamomile tea is used by humans for its calming effects, the flowers are not safe for cats to consume freely. Poisoning can occur if a cat ingests the plant material in significant quantities. Conversely, some veterinary sources suggest that small doses of Chamomile can be used as a soothing, cat-safe alternative to more toxic plants like Lavender, but this should be done under veterinary guidance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\nNote on Essential Oils: Some sources list Chamomile oil as an essential oil that is considered \"safe\" for cats (unlike tea tree or peppermint), provided it is not ingested and is used with caution. However, direct ingestion of any essential oil is generally discouraged.\n\u2022 Source:3",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, there is no specific veterinary treatment protocol explicitly outlined for Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) ingestion in the way there is for highly toxic plants like Lilies. However, since the sources identify Chamomile flowers as causing vomiting and diarrhea1, the recommended veterinary treatments follow the standard of care for plant poisoning resulting in gastrointestinal irritation.\nHere are the recommended treatments in order of priority:\n1. Veterinary Consultation and Assessment\n\u2022 Treatment name: Triage and Professional Assessment.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Contacting a veterinarian or an animal poison control center immediately to evaluate the risk. The vet will assess the amount ingested and the cat's current status to determine if a clinic visit is necessary.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Sources emphasize that \"it\u2019s always best to consult with your veterinarian\" if a cat consumes human food or drink like Chamomile tea or flowers1. Because Chamomile toxicity is typically linked to consuming \"large amounts,\" professional guidance ensures that minor ingestions are not over-treated while significant ones are managed appropriately1.\n2. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent (typically within 1\u20132 hours), a veterinarian may administer medication (such as xylazine or apomorphine) to induce vomiting and remove the plant material from the stomach.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: You should never attempt to induce vomiting at home (e.g., with hydrogen peroxide) without veterinary instruction, as this can cause severe irritation or aspiration2. This procedure is generally performed in a clinical setting to ensure safety.\n3. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n\u2022 Treatment name: Fluid Therapy and Medications (Antiemetics/Antidiarrheals).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Fluids: Administration of subcutaneous or intravenous fluids to correct dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhea34.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Medications: The use of antiemetics to stop vomiting and antidiarrheals to control loose stools4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Diet: Transitioning to a bland diet (e.g., boiled chicken) to soothe the stomach as the cat recovers4.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: For plants classified as gastrointestinal irritants, the prognosis is generally excellent with this type of care, and most animals recover within 24\u201348 hours4.\n4. Dermal Decontamination (If Essential Oil involved)\n\u2022 Treatment name: Dermal Washing / Bathing.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat was exposed to Chamomile essential oil (which is more concentrated than the plant) on its skin or fur, the vet will recommend bathing the cat with mild liquid dish soap and lukewarm water to prevent further absorption or ingestion during grooming5.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: While some sources list Chamomile oil as \"considered safe\" compared to other oils6, direct ingestion or skin absorption of any essential oil can be risky. Removing the source prevents the cat from licking toxic concentrations off their fur57."
