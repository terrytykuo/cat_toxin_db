For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) contains specific toxic compounds found within its sap and plant tissues. While often grouped with other Ficus species, specific sources highlight the presence of insoluble calcium oxalates for this plant.\n1. Insoluble Calcium Oxalate Crystals\n1. Name of the compound: Insoluble Calcium Oxalate crystals (often referred to as raphides).\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Physical Trauma and Irritation: These crystals are needle-like structures bundled in specialized plant cells. When a cat chews or crushes the plant tissue, these sharp crystals are forcefully shot out into the lining of the mouth, tongue, and throat. This causes immediate, intense pain and physical trauma to the tissues, leading to inflammation and swelling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Clinical Signs: The immediate pain typically causes the cat to stop eating quickly, but symptoms include excessive drooling, pawing at the mouth, oral swelling, and vomiting.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 These crystals are found within the irritant sap present in the leaves and stems of the plant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 The toxicity is generally considered mild, primarily resulting in local irritation rather than systemic organ damage.\nSources:1,2\n2. Proteolytic Enzymes (Ficin) and Psoralens (Furocoumarins)\n1. Name of the compound: Proteolytic Enzymes (specifically Ficin) and Psoralens (also known as Furocoumarins).\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Dermatitis and GI Irritation: These compounds are characteristic of the Ficus genus. They are found in the milky sap and can cause contact dermatitis (skin irritation, redness, and blisters) if the sap touches the cat's skin. Upon ingestion, they contribute to gastrointestinal distress, including vomiting and diarrhea.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 These compounds are concentrated in the milky sap (latex) found throughout the plant's leaves and stems.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 While usually causing mild to moderate symptoms, the sap can be irritating enough to cause significant discomfort.\nSources:3,4",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) contains toxic compounds, identified in some sources as insoluble calcium oxalate crystals within its irritant sap, and in others generally as the proteolytic enzymes and psoralens typical of the Ficus genus. The toxicity is generally considered mild.\n1. Oral Irritation\n1. Symptom Name: Oral Irritation (Pain and burning sensation in the mouth, tongue, and lips).\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal (Oral).\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Immediate (Upon chewing or biting into the leaf/stem).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The plant contains irritant sap (sometimes described as containing needle-like oxalate crystals) that causes immediate pain and inflammation when it contacts mucous membranes. This pain often deters the cat from consuming large amounts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Excessive Drooling (Hypersalivation)\n1. Symptom Name: Drooling / Hypersalivation.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Immediate to Acute (Shortly after oral contact).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: This is a physiological response to the burning sensation and irritation in the mouth and throat caused by the plant's sap.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n3. Vomiting\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Ingestion of the plant material or sap can irritate the stomach lining, triggering vomiting. The symptoms are usually self-limiting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n4. Dermal Irritation (Contact Dermatitis)\n1. Symptom Name: Skin Irritation / Redness (Contact Dermatitis).\n2. Affected Body System: Dermal (Skin).\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (Upon contact with sap).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The milky sap found in Ficus plants is a known irritant. If it gets on the cat's fur or skin, it can cause redness, itching, or blistering.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides) and proteolytic enzymes that cause immediate physical trauma and irritation to the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. Veterinary treatment focuses on soothing this irritation and managing symptoms, as systemic toxicity is rare.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Oral Decontamination and Rinsing\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Oral Irrigation / Decontamination.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The immediate priority is to remove any remaining plant material from the cat's mouth. The veterinarian (or owner, under instruction) will gently wipe the mouth and rinse it thoroughly with cool water. This flushes out the needle-like calcium oxalate crystals and irritating sap that are causing pain and inflammation.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This step is crucial because the primary mechanism of injury is physical trauma to the mucous membranes. Washing the skin is also necessary if sap has contacted the face or paws to prevent dermatitis or re-ingestion during grooming.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Administration of Demulcents (Soothing Agents)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Calcium-Containing Dairy Products (Milk or Yogurt).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: A veterinarian may administer or recommend offering a small amount of milk, yogurt, or a specific demulcent medication. These products help coat and soothe the irritated lining of the mouth and throat. Calcium in dairy can also help bind soluble oxalates (though Fiddle Leaf Fig primarily contains insoluble oxalates, the coating action effectively reduces pain from the crystals).\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is a specific counter-measure for calcium oxalate plants. It aids in the clearance of crystals from the oral cavity and esophagus and provides immediate relief from the burning sensation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,4\n3. Symptomatic Supportive Care\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Fluid Therapy and Anti-emetics.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is vomiting persistently or refusing to drink due to oral pain, subcutaneous or intravenous fluids are administered to maintain hydration. Medications to stop vomiting (anti-emetics) and protect the stomach lining (gastroprotectants) may be given if gastrointestinal distress is significant.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Most cases of Fiddle Leaf Fig ingestion are mild and self-limiting. Aggressive treatment is rarely needed unless the cat shows signs of airway swelling (laryngeal edema) causing breathing difficulties, which would require oxygen support and steroids, though this is uncommon.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,5"
