While the exact mechanism isn't described in the text, ingestion of these flowers irritates the system enough to cause gastrointestinal distress (such as vomiting and diarrhea) and can sometimes also result in dermatological symptoms1.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, there is no highly specific, unique medical protocol outlined exclusively for Pom Flowers (which include varieties like carnations). However, because Pom Flowers are classified as mildly poisonous and act as mild gastrointestinal and dermatological irritants1, veterinarians generally follow the standard treatment protocols for common GI-irritating plants2.\nIf your cat ingests a Pom Flower, the recommended steps and veterinary treatments, in order of priority, include:\n1. Immediate Veterinary Consultation\n1. Treatment name: Veterinary Assessment and Poison Control Guidance.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center immediately for tailored advice based on the amount ingested3. The vet will assess the cat's symptoms and determine if an in-clinic visit is necessary.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: You should call the vet right away and not wait for clinical signs of poisoning (like throwing up or diarrhea) to develop3.\n2. Symptomatic and Supportive Care for Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Treatment name: Antiemetic and Antidiarrheal Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: To manage the gastrointestinal distress caused by the flowers, the veterinarian may administer antiemetics to stop the vomiting and antidiarrheals to resolve the diarrhea. They will also typically recommend feeding the cat a bland diet while the stomach heals2.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because the toxicity of Pom Flowers is considered mild1, most cats will recover fully within 24 to 48 hours with basic supportive care. However, cats with underlying or pre-existing gastrointestinal diseases may require a longer course of treatment2.\n3. Dermatological Care\n1. Treatment name: Symptomatic Skin Treatment.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: If the cat develops skin irritation from contact with the plant, the vet may recommend wiping, washing, or treating the affected skin to soothe the irritation.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Ingestion or exposure to Pom Flowers can sometimes cause dermatological symptoms alongside stomach upset, so the vet will need to monitor and treat the skin if an allergic or irritant reaction appears1.\n4. Environmental Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Removal of the Plant Source.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Completely removing the Pom Flowers from the home or moving them to a location the cat absolutely cannot access4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: While this is an at-home step rather than a clinical medical procedure, veterinarians emphasize that removing the plant source is a necessary part of the treatment plan to prevent the cat from re-ingesting the flowers and prolonging the illness2.",
