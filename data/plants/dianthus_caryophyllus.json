List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Carnations (Dianthus caryophyllus) are classified as mildly poisonous to cats. Unlike highly toxic plants (such as lilies), ingestion typically results in mild gastrointestinal upset or skin irritation rather than organ failure. Therefore, veterinary treatment is largely supportive and symptomatic.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Veterinary Consultation and Triage\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Contacting a veterinarian or animal poison control center immediately to assess the severity of the situation based on the amount ingested and the cat's current symptoms.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because Carnations are considered only \"mildly toxic,\" a vet may advise monitoring the cat at home rather than immediate hospitalization, provided the symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) are not severe. Professional guidance prevents unnecessary stress for the cat while ensuring intervention is available if symptoms escalate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Symptomatic Supportive Care (Fluid Therapy)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of fluids (subcutaneous or intravenous) to prevent dehydration and correct electrolyte imbalances resulting from vomiting or diarrhea.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the primary treatment for most cases of plant poisoning causing gastrointestinal distress. If the cat is vomiting frequently or refusing water, fluid therapy helps maintain hydration and flush the system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,1,3\n3. Gastrointestinal Decontamination (Inducing Vomiting)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may administer medication to induce emesis (vomiting) to remove the plant material from the stomach before it is fully digested.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is generally performed only if the ingestion was very recent and significant. Sources note that inducing vomiting should not be attempted at home without professional advice, as it can risk injury or aspiration pneumonia.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:5,4\n4. Dermal Decontamination (Bathing)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Washing the cat's skin or fur with mild soap and warm water to remove plant sap or residue.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Carnations are noted to potentially cause dermatological symptoms (skin irritation) in addition to gastrointestinal issues. If the cat has rolled in or rubbed against the plant, removing the irritant prevents further dermatitis and stops the cat from ingesting more toxins while grooming.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,6"
