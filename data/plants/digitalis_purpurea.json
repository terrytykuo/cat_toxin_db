Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) causes severe poisoning in cats due to cardiac glycosides (like digitoxin and digoxin) that affect the heart and electrolyte balance. The entire plant is toxic, including water from a vase containing the flowers.\n1. Gastrointestinal Distress\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting, Bloody Diarrhea, and Nausea.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Within 2 hours (Acute).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Vomiting and abdominal pain are typically the first signs of toxicity. The plant acts as a direct irritant to the gut, but the toxins also stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Cardiac Arrhythmias\n1. Symptom Name: Bradycardia (Slow Heart Rate), Tachycardia (Fast Heart Rate), or Irregular Pulse.\n2. Affected Body System: Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Within 2 hours (and can persist for days).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The toxins inhibit the sodium-potassium pump in heart cells, causing a rise in intracellular calcium. This leads to forceful but irregular heart contractions, heart block, and potential cardiac collapse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,1,3\n3. Neurological Abnormalities\n1. Symptom Name: Weakness, Tremors, and Convulsions (Seizures).\n2. Affected Body System: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (following or accompanying cardiac signs).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Cats may appear uncoordinated (ataxia) or profoundly weak due to the cardiovascular compromise and direct neurotoxic effects. Dilated pupils (mydriasis) may also be observed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n4. Hyperkalemia\n1. Symptom Name: Hyperkalemia (High Potassium Levels).\n2. Affected Body System: Hematological / Metabolic.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (detectable via blood tests shortly after ingestion).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The inhibition of the cellular pump causes extracellular potassium to accumulate. Severe hyperkalemia (> 7.5\u20139 mEq/L) is life-threatening and complicates the heart rhythm issues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:3\n5. Frequent Urination\n1. Symptom Name: Frequent Urination.\n2. Affected Body System: Renal / Urinary.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: This symptom is specifically noted in veterinary toxicology reports for Foxglove ingestion, potentially linked to the body's attempt to excrete the toxins or cardiovascular shifts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) contains potent cardiac glycosides (specifically digitoxin, digoxin, and digitalin) that inhibit the sodium-potassium pump in the heart1,2. This results in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and electrolyte imbalances.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination (Emesis and Activated Charcoal)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis and Administration of Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion is recent and the cat is neurologically stable (not seizing), the veterinarian will induce vomiting to remove plant material from the stomach. This is followed by the administration of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind the toxins.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because cardiac glycosides undergo \"enterohepatic recirculation\" (the body reabsorbs the toxin), veterinarians recommend repeating the activated charcoal dose (without cathartic) every 6\u20138 hours for a total of three doses2. Decontamination should not be attempted at home with hydrogen peroxide, as this can cause further injury3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,2\n2. Administration of Specific Antidote (Digoxin Immune Fab)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Digoxin-specific Antibody Fragments (Fab).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: This is an immunotherapy treatment where specific antibody fragments bind to the cardiac glycoside toxins in the blood, neutralizing them and allowing the body to excrete them safely.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because the toxins in Foxglove are structurally similar to the heart medication digoxin, this specific antidote works well for Foxglove poisoning2. It is generally reserved for life-threatening cases due to cost and availability, but patients treated with this antidote have a guarded to good prognosis2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:2\n3. Cardiac Support Medications (Atropine and Anti-arrhythmics)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Pharmacological Heart Rate and Rhythm Management.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will administer atropine or glycopyrrolate to treat severe bradycardia (dangerously slow heart rate). If the cat is experiencing irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias), anti-arrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine, procainamide, or phenytoin may be used5,6,2.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is required to detect heart blocks or arrhythmias early5. The toxins cause the heart to contract more forcefully but slower; managing this balance is critical to survival7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:5,6,2\n4. Fluid Therapy and Electrolyte Correction\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy and Management of Hyperkalemia.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: IV fluids are administered to maintain blood pressure and support kidney function. Crucially, the vet will monitor for hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), a common and fatal result of Foxglove poisoning. Severe hyperkalemia (> 7.5\u20139 mEq/L) is treated with sodium bicarbonate or a dextrose and insulin therapy to lower potassium levels2.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Calcium should not be administered, as intracellular calcium is already dangerously high due to the toxin's mechanism of action7. Mild hyperkalemia may be managed with fluids alone, but severe cases require aggressive intervention to prevent cardiac standstill2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,5,2"
