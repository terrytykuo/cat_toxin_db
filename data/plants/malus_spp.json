(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the following parts of the Apple plant (Malus spp.) are considered toxic or dangerous to cats:\n\u2022 Seeds (Pips): The seeds are the primary source of toxicity. They contain amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside that releases cyanide when the seeds are chewed, crushed, or digested1.... While a single seed may not cause immediate harm, significant or repeated ingestion can lead to cyanide poisoning46.\n\u2022 Core: The core is considered toxic primarily because it contains the seeds78. Additionally, the core poses a physical risk as a choking hazard or cause of intestinal obstruction1....\n\u2022 Leaves: Plants containing cyanogenic glycosides, such as the apple tree (Malus spp.), generally house these toxins in the leaves as well as the seeds1112.\nSafe Parts:\n\u2022 Fruit (Flesh): The flesh of the apple is generally considered safe for cats to eat in small amounts, provided the seeds, core, and skin (which can be tough to digest) are removed7....\nSummary of Toxic Parts:\n\u2022 Seeds13\n\u2022 Core (due to seeds and obstruction risk)89\n\u2022 Leaves1112",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Apple plant (Malus spp.) contains one primary toxic compound group that harms cats, located specifically within the seeds (pips), leaves, and stems.\n1. Amygdalin (Cyanogenic Glycoside)\n1. Name of the compound: The specific compound found in apple seeds is Amygdalin, which is a type of Cyanogenic Glycoside. When metabolized by the cat's body, this compound releases Hydrogen Cyanide (often referred to simply as Cyanide), which is the active toxic agent1....\n2. Chemical formula: The sources explicitly identify the release of HCN (Hydrogen Cyanide) as the toxic metabolic product3.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Activation: Amygdalin is relatively harmless in its intact form. However, when the apple seed is chewed, crushed, or digested, the compound interacts with digestive enzymes to undergo hydrolysis, releasing hydrogen cyanide into the bloodstream1....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cellular Disruption: Once absorbed, the cyanide interferes with cellular respiration. It tightly binds to ferric (Fe3+) iron within cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme in the mitochondria1....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Oxygen Starvation: This binding disrupts the final step of the electron transport chain, preventing cells from utilizing oxygen to generate energy (ATP). This leads to tissue hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) and cellular death, even though the blood is fully oxygenated1....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Feline Susceptibility: Cats are noted to lack certain enzymes required to break down such toxins effectively, making them particularly susceptible to toxicity due to their metabolic limitations and small body size78.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Location: The toxin is concentrated in the seeds (pips), leaves, and stems; the flesh of the apple is considered safe and non-toxic2....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Bioavailability: Apple seeds have a hard outer shell that often allows them to pass through the digestive tract intact without releasing the toxin. The seed must be crushed or chewed to pose a significant threat3....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: While the amount of cyanide in a single seed is described as \"trace\" or \"minuscule\"1213, the toxin itself is \"highly toxic\" and potent214. Because cats are small, even small amounts of toxin can have a significant impact, though a single seed is unlikely to cause immediate harm415. Estimates for \"small pets\" suggest symptoms might appear after ingesting around 200 seeds, but any exposure is discouraged due to the rapid onset of severe symptoms like respiratory distress and shock716.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the flesh of the apple is generally safe, but the seeds (which contain amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside), leaves, and stems are toxic. If a cat ingests these parts\u2014particularly if the seeds are crushed or chewed\u2014it can lead to cyanide poisoning.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show:\n1. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom name: Respiratory Distress (Difficulty Breathing, Panting, Tachypnea).\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid; often within 10\u201360 minutes to a few hours after ingestion.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Signs include panting, gasping for breath, or rapid breathing. This occurs because the cyanide toxin prevents cells from utilizing oxygen (cellular hypoxia), effectively suffocating cells even though the blood is oxygenated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4,5\n2. Brick Red Mucous Membranes\n1. Symptom name: Bright Red Gums/Tongue (Mucous Membrane Discoloration).\n2. Affected body system: Hematological / Cardiovascular.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (minutes to hours).\n5. Additional clinical notes: The gums and tongue may appear unusually bright red or pink. This \"cherry red\" blood coloring is a classic sign of cyanide toxicity, resulting from the abundance of oxygen in the blood that tissues are unable to absorb.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:6,2,3,4,5\n3. Dilated Pupils\n1. Symptom name: Dilated Pupils (Mydriasis).\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Ocular.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (minutes to hours).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Enlarged pupils are a frequent sign of cyanide poisoning listed alongside respiratory distress and shock.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:6,1,2,3\n4. Seizures and Tremors\n1. Symptom name: Seizures, Convulsions, and Tremors.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (often within an hour).\n5. Additional clinical notes: As the brain is deprived of usable oxygen, the cat may experience muscle tremors, convulsions, and eventually lapse into a coma.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3,4,5\n5. Shock and Collapse\n1. Symptom name: Shock / Sudden Collapse / Weakness.\n2. Affected body system: Cardiovascular / Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (10\u201360 minutes).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Hypotension (low blood pressure) and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) can lead to sudden collapse and death if untreated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:6,1,3,4,7,5\n6. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Salivation (Drooling).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate (usually the initial signs).\n4. Typical onset time: Minutes to hours.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Cats may also exhibit excessive drooling. In cases of cyanide ingestion, the breath may sometimes have a distinct almond-like odor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,4,5",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the flesh of the apple is generally safe, but the seeds (which contain cyanogenic glycosides) and the core (which poses a choking or obstruction hazard) are the primary risks.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments for apple ingestion (specifically seeds and cores), listed in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Emesis & Activated Charcoal)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent and the cat is asymptomatic, the veterinarian may induce vomiting (emesis) to expel the seeds or core from the stomach. This is often followed by the administration of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind toxins in the digestive tract and speed up their removal.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the standard protocol for asymptomatic patients who have ingested a large number of seeds. Owners are advised not to induce vomiting at home unless specifically directed by a veterinarian, as it can be dangerous.\n\u2022 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Specific Antidote Administration\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: In cases of severe cyanide poisoning (from crushed/chewed seeds), veterinarians may administer specific antidotes. These include sodium nitrite (to form cyanomethemoglobin) followed by sodium thiosulfate (to form thiocyanate), or hydroxycobalamin (which binds with cyanide to form Vitamin B12).\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This treatment is critical if the cat shows signs of hypoxia (oxygen starvation) such as bright red gums, seizures, or respiratory distress. Hydroxycobalamin is noted as an available option in the US and Europe.\n\u2022 Sources:4,3\n3. Oxygen Therapy\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of supplemental oxygen to the cat.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because cyanide prevents the body's cells from utilizing oxygen (cellular hypoxia), oxygen therapy is a vital supportive measure to help the cat recover, particularly if respiratory distress is present.\n\u2022 Sources:4,5\n4. Correction of Metabolic Acidosis\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct the pH balance of the cat's blood.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Cyanide toxicity can cause severe metabolic acidosis. Veterinarians will monitor this via venous blood gas analysis and treat it if present to stabilize the cat's condition.\n\u2022 Sources:3\n5. Surgical Intervention or Endoscopy\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The physical removal of the apple core from the esophagus, stomach, or intestines using a flexible camera with tools (endoscope) or via surgical incision.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This treatment is reserved for cases where the apple core has been swallowed whole or in large pieces, causing a physical obstruction or blockage in the digestive tract, which can be life-threatening.\n\u2022 Sources:6,1,7"
