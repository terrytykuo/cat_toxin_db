Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Croton (Codiaeum variegatum) plant contains specific substances within its sap that are harmful to cats.\n1. Irritant Oils and Resins\n1. Name of the compound: The sources describe these simply as irritant oils and resins. The specific toxins are noted as \"not fully characterized\" in the provided text.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources (due to the toxins being uncharacterized mixtures of oils/resins).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Direct Irritation: These compounds act as contact irritants to the mucous membranes and skin. When a cat chews on the plant, the release of these oils causes irritation to the mouth (oral irritation), leading to drooling and refusal to eat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Gastrointestinal Upset: Upon ingestion, the irritation extends to the gastrointestinal tract, triggering vomiting and diarrhea.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Dermatitis: Direct contact with the sap can also cause skin irritation or rashes.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Location: The toxic oils and resins are found in the sap, which is present in all parts of the plant (leaves and stems).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Severity: The toxicity is classified as moderate.

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Croton (Codiaeum variegatum) contains irritant oils and resins in its sap that cause moderate toxicity, primarily manifesting as oral irritation and gastrointestinal upset.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Mechanical Decontamination (Rinsing and Washing)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Oral Rinsing and Dermal Decontamination.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The immediate treatment involves rinsing the cat's mouth with water to remove the plant material and irritant sap. If sap is present on the fur or skin, it must be washed off using mild soap and water.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because the sap contains irritant oils, this step is crucial to stop the burning sensation in the mouth and prevent dermatitis. Handlers should wear gloves during this process to avoid irritation to their own skin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Fluid Therapy / Rehydration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Veterinarians may administer fluids to the cat, typically intravenously, to maintain hydration levels and correct electrolyte imbalances.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is necessary if the cat has experienced significant vomiting or diarrhea\u2014common symptoms of Croton ingestion\u2014which can lead to dehydration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,1\n3. Symptomatic Supportive Care\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Symptomatic Management and Monitoring.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team will monitor the cat for progression of symptoms and may administer medications to control vomiting (anti-emetics) or pain if the oral irritation is severe.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: While Croton toxicity is generally moderate, veterinary attention is required if vomiting or irritation persists. The veterinarian will determine if further intervention, such as inducing vomiting, is safe or necessary based on the cat's condition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,1"
