What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the only information available regarding the Yellow Oleander (Thevetia peruviana) is that it is a common houseplant and ornamental plant that contains highly toxic cardiac glycosides12. The sources do not contain information about the plant's botanical family, detailed physical appearance, or habitat.\n(Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it):\n1. Botanical Family The Yellow Oleander belongs to the dogbane family, Apocynaceae (the same family as the common pink/white oleander, Nerium oleander).\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: Yellow Oleander is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub or small tree that can reach up to 10 to 20 feet in height. It features spirally arranged, narrow, willow-like, glossy green leaves. It is heavily prized for its fragrant, funnel- or trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow (but can also be pale orange or peach). After flowering, it produces distinctively shaped, fleshy, somewhat triangular or globular seed pods that start green and turn black as they ripen.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to tropical regions of the Americas (ranging from Mexico into Central and South America), it thrives in full sun and well-draining soils. Because it is highly drought-tolerant and features striking flowers, it is widely cultivated globally and is very commonly found planted as an ornamental shrub, hedge, or street tree in warm, tropical, and subtropical climates.",

(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Yellow Oleander (Thevetia peruviana) contains highly toxic cardiac glycosides12. However, the sources do not explicitly detail which specific parts of the Yellow Oleander are toxic.\nThe sources do note that for the closely related common Oleander (Nerium oleander), the entire plant (all parts) is highly toxic to cats, to the point that even the water in a plant base or vase can contain toxic components34.\n(Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it: Just like the common oleander, every part of the Yellow Oleander plant\u2014including its leaves, stems, flowers, bark, roots, and sap\u2014is highly toxic to cats. The most lethal concentration of its toxins is typically found in the plant's fruit and seeds).",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, here are the details regarding the toxic compounds found in Yellow Oleander (Thevetia peruviana) that are harmful to cats:\n1. Cardiac Glycosides (Cardenolides)\n1. Name of the compound: Cardiac glycosides (specifically noted in related oleander species as cardenolides, such as oleandrin)1....\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Cardiac glycosides directly interfere with the electrical signaling and muscle contractions of the cat's heart13. They do this by inhibiting the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase pump, which is a necessary component for normal cardiac function35. This inhibition causes an accumulation of intracellular sodium (Na\n+\n) and extracellular potassium (K\n+\n), which subsequently leads to a dangerous rise in intracellular calcium (Ca\n++\n)35. The result is that the heart's contractions become more forceful but abnormally slow (bradycardia), eventually leading to life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) and potential cardiovascular collapse1....\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Cardiac glycosides are extremely potent and have a very narrow margin of safety6. Because the toxins are so powerful, there is no safe level of ingestion; even a very small amount of the plant\u2014or simply drinking the water from a plant base or vase\u2014can be fatal to cats23. While the toxins are present in all parts of the plant, they are highly concentrated and can cause a rapid onset of severe gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms1....",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the sources provided, Yellow Oleander (Thevetia peruviana) contains cardiac glycosides, which are highly toxic compounds that require immediate and aggressive veterinary care. Here are the recommended treatments listed in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Emesis Induction and Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is asymptomatic and ingested the plant recently, the veterinarian will induce vomiting to clear the stomach, followed by administering a dose of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind unabsorbed toxins1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because the toxins undergo enterohepatic recirculation (recirculating between the liver and intestines), the vet will likely repeat the activated charcoal (without a cathartic) every 6 to 8 hours for a total of 3 doses to ensure the toxins are fully neutralized1.\n2. Antidote Administration\n1. Treatment name: Digoxin-Specific Antibody Fragments (Fab).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team administers a specific antidote originally designed for digoxin medication toxicity, which works effectively to neutralize the plant's cardiac glycosides1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Patients who have access to this specific antidote generally have a guarded to good prognosis, while those without access have a guarded to poor prognosis1.\n3. Intravenous Fluid Therapy and Electrolyte Management\n1. Treatment name: IV Fluid Therapy and Hyperkalemia Treatment.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The cat is given intravenous fluids to provide hemodynamic (blood flow) support while electrolytes are closely monitored1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Yellow Oleander poisoning can cause a life-threatening spike in potassium. While mild hyperkalemia can be managed with IV fluids alone, severe hyperkalemia (> 7.5\u20139mEq/L) requires urgent, targeted treatment using sodium bicarbonate or a dextrose/insulin therapy1.\n4. Antiarrhythmic and Cardiovascular Medications\n1. Treatment name: Pharmacological Cardiac Support (e.g., Lidocaine, Atropine, Glycopyrrolate).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian administers specific heart medications to control the life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities caused by the toxins1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Antiarrhythmics like lidocaine are heavily relied upon if the digoxin-specific antidote is not available1. Additionally, if the cat is suffering from severe bradycardia (an abnormally slow heart rate), medications such as atropine or glycopyrrolate are successfully used to stabilize the heart rate1."
