(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, all parts of the Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum) are considered toxic to cats1. The toxic compounds, specifically insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides), are notably concentrated within the plant's foliage (leaves)2.\nImportant Clinical Note: While the Peace Lily has \"lily\" in its name, it is an \"imposter lily\" and does not contain the deadly toxins found in true lilies (Lilium species) that cause acute kidney failure3.... Instead, chewing or ingesting any part of the Peace Lily releases the oxalate crystals, which act as physical irritants and cause immediate, intense burning in the mouth and throat, excessive drooling, and mild to moderate gastrointestinal upset1....",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Insoluble Calcium Oxalate Crystals (Raphides)\n1. Name of the compound: Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, specifically in a needle-like form known as raphides1....\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: The needle-like oxalate crystals are bundled and stored inside specialized plant cells called idioblasts4. When a cat bites, chews, or crushes the plant material, these idioblasts rupture and shoot the sharp raphides into the surrounding tissues4. The crystals act as tiny needles that physically pierce and traumatize the oral cavity and gastrointestinal mucous membranes34. This mechanical irritation causes immediate, intense burning and pain in the mouth and throat, leading to excessive drooling, pawing at the mouth, tissue swelling (edema), and vomiting2.... Importantly, because the Peace Lily is an \"imposter lily,\" this mechanism only causes localized oral and gastrointestinal distress, rather than the systemic, fatal kidney failure caused by true lilies35.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The overall toxicity of the Peace Lily is considered mild to moderate12. The insoluble calcium oxalate crystals are found throughout all parts of the plant, with raphides notably present within the foliage26. Because chewing the plant causes immediate and intense pain, cats usually stop eating it right away; this naturally limits the amount of the plant they consume, making severe poisoning rare and the prognosis for a full recovery excellent4.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum species) is an \"imposter lily\"; unlike true lilies, it does not cause fatal systemic kidney failure12. Instead, it contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that cause localized irritation when chewed13.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingesting or being exposed to a Peace Lily:\n1. Intense Oral Pain and Irritation\n1. Symptom name: Intense burning, pain, irritation, erythema (redness), and pawing at the mouth.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (specifically the oral cavity).\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This immediate pain is caused by the needle-like insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides) physically piercing the mucous membranes as the cat bites into the plant14. This intense, sudden pain usually limits the amount of the plant the cat actually consumes5.\n2. Excessive Drooling and Difficulty Swallowing\n1. Symptom name: Hypersalivation (excessive drooling) and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is a direct response to the oral trauma and tissue swelling (edema) in the tongue and pharynx46. Rinsing the cat's mouth out with water or offering a calcium-containing dairy product (like milk) can help bind the crystals and soothe the irritation46.\n3. Stomach Upset (Vomiting and Diarrhea)\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, stomach upset, and occasionally diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate to shortly after ingestion.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: If the cat manages to swallow the plant material, the crystals will continue to irritate the gastrointestinal tract, causing vomiting and diarrhea2.... However, this irritation remains localized and does not cause systemic organ failure1.\n4. Lethargy and Loss of Appetite\n1. Symptom name: Lethargy and anorexia (refusal to eat).\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Systemic (secondary to gastrointestinal pain).\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Shortly after ingestion.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Because the cat's mouth and throat are inflamed and in pain, they will often refuse food and appear lethargic or depressed47.\n5. Respiratory Distress (Rare)\n1. Symptom name: Difficulty breathing (dyspnea).\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate to shortly after exposure, as swelling progresses.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: While generally rare and usually easily treatable, if the edema (swelling) spreads to the laryngeal region (the throat/airway), it can obstruct the airway and cause potentially life-threatening respiratory distress46. You should monitor the cat closely for throat swelling and seek veterinary care to secure an airway if breathing issues arise46.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum species) is not a \"true\" lily and does not cause fatal kidney failure12. Instead, it contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides) that act as mechanical irritants to the mouth and gastrointestinal tract23. Most cases have an excellent prognosis and often fully resolve even without extensive veterinary intervention3.\nHowever, if veterinary care is needed, the recommended treatments, prioritized from most urgent to general care, include:\n1. Airway Management and Oxygen Support\n1. Treatment name: Securing an Airway and Oxygen Support.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will closely monitor the cat's throat for severe tissue swelling (laryngeal edema) caused by the irritating crystals. If the swelling threatens to block the airway, the vet will immediately secure the airway (intubation) and provide supplemental oxygen3.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is an emergency measure that is only necessary in severe but rare cases where the inflammatory response in the throat causes respiratory distress34.\n2. Oral Decontamination and Crystal Binding\n1. Treatment name: Removal of Plant Material and Oral Rinsing.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The mouth is gently wiped out to physically remove any remaining plant material3. The oral cavity is then thoroughly rinsed with water to dilute and clear away the sharp, needle-like oxalate crystals34.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Veterinarians (or owners at home, if instructed) may offer the cat milk or other calcium-containing dairy products. The insoluble oxalates bind directly to the calcium in the dairy, which helps clear the crystals from the mouth and esophagus and soothes the intense burning sensation3.\n3. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: General Supportive Care and Monitoring.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The cat is observed for ongoing oral pain, drooling, or mild stomach upset, and given basic supportive care until the localized irritation naturally subsides34.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because the Peace Lily is an \"imposter lily\" containing only insoluble oxalates, there is no risk of systemic kidney injury3. Therefore, aggressive systemic treatments like intensive IV fluid flushing or dialysis\u2014which are required for true lily ingestions\u2014are completely unnecessary13. Full recovery is expected3."
