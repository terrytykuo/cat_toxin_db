For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Cyanogenic Glycosides (Hydrogen Cyanide)\n1. Name of the compound: Cyanogenic glycosides, which metabolize and break down to release cyanide (specifically hydrogen cyanide)1....\n2. Chemical formula: HCN (for Hydrogen Cyanide)1.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: When a cat chews, grinds, or crushes the plant material, the cyanogenic glycosides are altered and release toxic cyanide into the body2. Once absorbed, the cyanide binds to ferric iron (Fe\n3+\n), specifically inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase24. This interference halts cellular respiration, completely preventing the cells from utilizing oxygen and resulting in rapid, life-threatening tissue hypoxia (oxygen deprivation)24.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The toxic cyanogenic glycosides are generally concentrated within the leaves of the plant and the seeds of its fruit2. Severe toxicity is relatively uncommon unless a large amount of the plant is ingested2. Furthermore, the seeds must be physically compromised to pose a danger; if a cat swallows a seed completely whole without chewing it, the cyanide is not released and toxicity is not expected2.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBecause Mountain Mahogany contains cyanogenic glycosides, ingesting the chewed or crushed seeds or leaves releases highly toxic hydrogen cyanide into the cat's body12. Cyanide rapidly halts cellular respiration, completely preventing the cells from utilizing oxygen13.\nIf a cat is exposed to a toxic dose of these cyanogenic compounds, they will exhibit the symptoms of acute cyanide poisoning. Here are the symptoms to watch for:\n1. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom name: Respiratory distress (panting, gasping for breath, or labored breathing).\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Within minutes to hours4.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is typically one of the most prominent signs of cyanide poisoning, occurring because the toxin severely hampers the body's ability to utilize oxygen at the cellular level45.\n2. Unusual Gum Color (Bright Red Gums)\n1. Symptom name: Unusually red or pink gums (bright red mucous membranes).\n2. Affected body system: Hematological / Cardiovascular.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Within minutes to hours4.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This distinct symptom happens because the cells are unable to extract oxygen from the blood. The blood remains fully oxygenated, causing the gums and mucous membranes to appear bright red while the body's tissues are essentially suffocating35.\n3. Dilated Pupils\n1. Symptom name: Dilated pupils.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Ocular.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Within minutes to hours4.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Abnormally large pupils act as an indicator of severe systemic stress and neurological impairment from the rapid lack of usable oxygen3....\n4. Excessive Drooling\n1. Symptom name: Excessive drooling (hypersalivation).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Within minutes to hours4.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Salivating much more than usual can be one of the earlier, acute signs of toxic exposure before severe neurological decline sets in5.\n5. Shock, Seizures, and Coma\n1. Symptom name: Shock, seizures (convulsions), loss of consciousness, and coma.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Within minutes to hours4.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: These extreme neurological and cardiovascular symptoms manifest as the oxygen deprivation peaks. Cyanide poisoning acts very quickly; if prompt veterinary attention (which may include oxygen therapy and specific antidotes) is not provided, it rapidly progresses to death3...."
