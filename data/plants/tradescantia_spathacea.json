(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, all parts of the Oyster Plant (Tradescantia spathacea) are considered toxic to cats1.\nSpecifically, the plant contains an irritant sap (found within the leaves and stems) that causes mild gastrointestinal upset and occasional skin irritation upon contact1.",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, here are the details regarding the toxic compounds found in the Oyster Plant (Tradescantia spathacea) that can harm cats:\n1. Irritant Sap (containing Oxalates)\n1. Name of the compound: The plant's sap contains irritating compounds, specifically oxalates (calcium oxalate crystals) along with other unspecified irritants1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: The sap acts as a direct physical and chemical irritant. When a cat bites or chews the plant, the sap is released, causing immediate irritation to the oral mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract, which leads to drooling and vomiting1. Additionally, it acts as a contact irritant; if the sap gets onto the cat's fur or skin, it can occasionally cause localized skin irritation or rash1.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The overall toxicity level of the Oyster Plant is considered mild1. The irritant sap is distributed throughout all parts of the plant, but is specifically noted as being contained within the leaves1.",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Oyster Plant (Tradescantia spathacea) is mildly toxic to cats because all parts of the plant, especially the leaves, contain an irritant sap made up of oxalates and other irritating compounds1.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after exposure:\n1. Gastrointestinal Upset (Drooling and Vomiting)\n1. Symptom name: Drooling (hypersalivation) and vomiting1.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal1.\n3. Severity: Mild1.\n4. Typical onset time: The sources do not specify an exact timeframe, but because it is an immediate physical irritant, symptoms typically begin shortly after the cat bites or chews the plant.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: If your cat ingests this plant, you should gently wipe out their mouth to remove any residual irritant sap and offer water1. You should monitor them for persistent vomiting and consult a veterinarian if symptoms worsen or do not resolve1.\n2. Skin Irritation\n1. Symptom name: Skin irritation or rash1.\n2. Affected body system: Dermal1.\n3. Severity: Mild1.\n4. Typical onset time: The sources do not specify an exact timeframe, but it occurs upon direct physical contact with the plant's sap1.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is an occasional symptom that happens when the cat's skin or fur comes into contact with the sap1. It is recommended to wipe the cat's paws to remove the sap, and to consult a vet if the rash persists1."
