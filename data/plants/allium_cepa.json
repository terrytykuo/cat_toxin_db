Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nAll parts of the onion plant (Allium cepa), as well as other members of the Allium genus, are considered highly toxic to cats12.\nWhile the sources do not explicitly break down the toxicity by specific anatomical parts (like stems, leaves, or roots), they emphasize that the plant itself and the commonly consumed vegetable portion (the bulb) pose a severe risk in every form of preparation12.\nThis means the onion is dangerous to your cat whether it is:\n\u2022 Raw12\n\u2022 Cooked12\n\u2022 Processed2\n\u2022 Dehydrated or dried12\n\u2022 Highly concentrated, such as in onion powder or seasoning mixes13",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the primary toxic components in onions (and other Allium vegetables like garlic, leeks, and chives) are:\n1. Sulfur Compounds (Specifically N-propyl disulfide)\n1. Name of the compound: Sulfur compounds, most notably N-propyl disulfide1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: These sulfur compounds cause severe oxidative damage to a cat's red blood cells12. This oxidative stress leads to the formation of \"Heinz bodies,\" which are clumps of denatured hemoglobin inside the cells1. Because of this damage, the red blood cells die off much more rapidly than normal and are prematurely removed and destroyed by the cat's spleen12. This widespread destruction of red blood cells results in a life-threatening condition known as hemolytic anemia, meaning the blood can no longer effectively transport oxygen12. Cats are far more susceptible to this toxicity than dogs because of their unique feline hemoglobin structure1.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The toxic threshold for a cat is generally reached when they ingest an amount equal to 0.5% of their body weight3. The potency of these toxins is incredibly resilient; the plant remains highly toxic regardless of whether it is raw, cooked, processed, or dried13. Because the water is removed, highly concentrated forms like onion powder or seasoning mixes are exceptionally dangerous and can cause severe toxicity even in very small quantities14. (Note: While onions are highly toxic, the sources mention that garlic, which contains the same compounds, is approximately five times more toxic than onions1).",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nOnions (Allium cepa) contain sulfur compounds that cause severe oxidative damage to a cat's red blood cells, leading to a life-threatening condition called hemolytic anemia1. Notably, the symptoms of onion poisoning often have a delayed onset and may not appear until several days after the cat has ingested the plant12.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after being exposed to onions:\n1. Hemolytic Anemia, Discolored Gums, and Dark Urine\n1. Symptom name: Hemolytic anemia, pale, white, or yellow (jaundiced) mucous membranes/gums, and dark urine.\n2. Affected body system: Hematological (and secondary Renal).\n3. Severity: Severe to fatal3.\n4. Typical onset time: May not appear for several days following ingestion12.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is the primary and most dangerous hallmark of onion toxicity14. The toxins destroy the red blood cells, severely impairing the blood's ability to carry oxygen1. The destroyed red blood cells are processed and excreted by the body, which causes the cat's urine to become abnormally dark4.\n2. Lethargy, Weakness, and Collapse\n1. Symptom name: Lethargy, profound weakness, stumbling (ataxia), collapse, and seeking out warm spaces.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological and Musculoskeletal (secondary to hematological oxygen deprivation).\n3. Severity: Moderate to severe.\n4. Typical onset time: May not appear for several days following ingestion12.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Because the damaged red blood cells can no longer transport oxygen effectively, the cat will experience significant energy loss, depression, lack of coordination when walking, and an urge to seek out warm areas3....\n3. Cardiopulmonary Distress\n1. Symptom name: Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), rapid breathing, and breathing difficulties.\n2. Affected body system: Cardiac and Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: May not appear for several days following ingestion12.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: As the red blood cell count drops and the body becomes starved of oxygen, the cat's heart and lungs are forced to work much harder and faster to compensate, leading to cardiovascular and respiratory distress2....\n4. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, and abdominal pain.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: May not appear for several days following ingestion2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: The compounds in Allium plants are irritating to the gastrointestinal mucosa, which can trigger stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea alongside the systemic red blood cell destruction2....",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nThe provided sources do not contain a specific, prioritized list of veterinary treatments for onion toxicity in cats.\nThe sources do emphasize that if you suspect your cat has ingested onions, you should seek immediate emergency veterinary intervention or contact a pet poison control hotline12. Because onions cause severe oxidative damage to red blood cells (leading to life-threatening hemolytic anemia), the clinical signs of poisoning often have a delayed onset and may not appear for several days after ingestion34.\nWhile the texts outline general veterinary procedures used for poisonings\u2014such as medically inducing vomiting (which should never be attempted at home for cats), administering activated charcoal to bind toxins, and providing intravenous (IV) fluid therapy\u2014they do not explicitly specify the exact treatment protocol or priority for onion ingestion5....\nWould you like me to perform a fast web search to find the specific, prioritized veterinary treatments for onion poisoning in cats?"
