For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nThe Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica) contains a milky sap within its leaves and stems that houses several mildly toxic compounds12. The primary toxic substances identified in the plant are:\n1. Ficin (a Proteolytic Enzyme)\n1. Name of the compound: Ficin.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Ficin is a proteolytic (protein-breaking) enzyme that acts as a physical irritant. Upon contact or ingestion, it causes irritation to the mucous membranes of the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract, leading to drooling, vomiting, and diarrhea1. It is also implicated in causing contact dermatitis (redness and irritation) if the sap gets on the cat's skin13.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The overall toxicity is considered mild1. The toxin is primarily concentrated within the plant's milky sap12.\n2. Psoralen (Ficusin) and Furocoumarins\n1. Name of the compound: Psoralen (also referred to as ficusin), along with other furocoumarins, sesquiterpenoid glycosides, and triterpenes13.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Similar to ficin, these compounds are irritants. If ingested or touched, they contribute to the oral irritation, gastrointestinal distress, and contact dermatitis experienced by the cat13.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: These compounds are localized in the plant's sap23. The overall potency is mild, though the sap can cause notable discomfort to the skin and digestive system13.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, exposure to or ingestion of the Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica) generally causes mild irritation due to the toxic compounds (such as the proteolytic enzyme ficin and psoralens) found in its milky sap.\nHere are the specific symptoms a cat may show:\n1. Oral Irritation and Drooling\n1. Symptom name: Irritation of the mouth and drooling (hypersalivation)1.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (oral cavity)1.\n3. Severity: Mild1.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources, but typically occurs upon chewing the plant1.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is caused by the physical and chemical irritation from the proteolytic enzymes (ficin) and psoralen (ficusin) within the plant's sap12.\n2. Gastrointestinal Upset (Vomiting and Diarrhea)\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting and diarrhea1.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal1.\n3. Severity: Mild1.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources1.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: If the cat swallows the irritating sap, it leads to mild stomach and intestinal upset1.\n3. Contact Dermatitis (Skin Irritation)\n1. Symptom name: Skin redness and contact dermatitis12.\n2. Affected body system: Dermal12.\n3. Severity: Mild1.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources12.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Contact dermatitis occurs if the plant's milky sap gets on the cat's skin or fur1. The sap contains multiple irritants, including furocoumarins, psoralens, ficin, sesquiterpenoid glycosides, and triterpenes, which are directly implicated in causing this skin reaction2.",

Cite your sources.\n\ud83d\udcda Notebook: https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/9ef4df26-178b-446d-8e9d-e57cbe878a0d\n  \ud83c\udf10 Opening notebook...\n  \u23f3 Waiting for query input...\n  \u2713 Found input: textarea.query-box-input\n  \u23f3 Typing question...\n  \ud83d\udce4 Submitting...\n  \u23f3 Waiting for answer...\n  \u2705 Got answer!\n\n============================================================\nQuestion: What are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests Rubber Plant? List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, ingestion of or exposure to a Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica) generally results in mild toxicity, primarily causing oral and gastrointestinal irritation or contact dermatitis. Because the toxicity is mild, the primary treatments begin with immediate decontamination rather than invasive emergency procedures.\nHere are the recommended treatments in order of priority:\n1. Oral and Dermal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Rinsing and Sap Removal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Rinse out the cat's mouth with water and thoroughly wipe off any milky sap from the cat's fur and skin1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is the most urgent first step. The plant's sap contains irritating proteolytic enzymes (ficin) and psoralens. Removing the sap immediately stops the localized burning in the mouth, prevents the cat from ingesting more sap while grooming, and helps prevent contact dermatitis on the skin12.\n2. Hydration and Monitoring\n1. Treatment name: Hydration and At-Home Monitoring.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Offer the cat water to drink and monitor them for any ongoing clinical signs, such as continued vomiting, drooling, or skin redness1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because Rubber Plant toxicity is considered mild, many cases resolve on their own once the irritant is removed. Drinking water helps soothe the irritated mucous membranes in the mouth and throat1.\n3. Veterinary Intervention\n1. Treatment name: Symptomatic and Supportive Care.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: If the cat experiences persistent vomiting, diarrhea, or severe skin irritation that does not resolve, they should be taken to a veterinarian for professional symptomatic care12.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: While not explicitly detailed for the Rubber Plant in the sources, standard veterinary symptomatic care for persistent GI upset or contact dermatitis typically involves administering anti-nausea medications, fluid therapy for dehydration, or skin-soothing topical treatments12."
