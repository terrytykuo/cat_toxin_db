What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, here is the information regarding Cannabis / Marijuana (Cannabis sativa):\n1. Botanical Family Cannabis sativa belongs to the Cannabaceae family1.\n2. Brief Description\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Appearance: It is an annual herb that can grow to be 1.8 meters (approx. 6 feet) or taller. The leaves are palmately compound (shaped like a hand), typically consisting of 5\u20137 linear leaflets with coarsely toothed (dentate) edges. The plant produces small green flowers; male flowers appear at the tip, while female flowers grow along the entire length of the branch1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Habitat & Location: While the plant has historical roots as a source for rope, textiles, and paper, it is now primarily cultivated for medicinal or recreational purposes2. In many states, it is legally cultivated under specific licenses1. In a domestic setting, it is most commonly found as dried plant material (\"marijuana\"), edibles (baked goods, candies), or oils2.\nSources:\n\u2022 Houseplants and Ornamentals Toxic to Animals - Merck Veterinary Manual1\n\u2022 Cannabis (Marijuana) Intoxication in Cats and Dogs - VCA Animal Hospitals2",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the primary toxic compound in Cannabis / Marijuana (Cannabis sativa) that harms cats is Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).\n1. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\n1. Name of the compound: Tetrahydrocannabinol (specifically delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly abbreviated as THC).\n2. Chemical formula: The provided sources do not explicitly list the chemical formula (which is C\n21\n\t\u200b\n\nH\n30\n\t\u200b\n\nO\n2\n\t\u200b\n\n), but they identify it as the specific cannabinoid responsible for the plant's psychoactive effects.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Neurotransmitter Alteration: Upon ingestion or inhalation, THC enters the body and interacts with the brain's chemical messengers. It alters the activity of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Receptor Binding: THC binds to specific cannabinoid receptors in the brain. While sources note that dogs have a high density of these receptors (making them very sensitive), cats are also susceptible to these neurochemical changes, which lead to the clinical signs of intoxication12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Lipid Solubility: THC is highly lipid-soluble (dissolves in fats), meaning it is easily stored in the fatty tissues of the liver, brain, and kidneys, which can prolong its elimination from the body3.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Plant Parts: THC is found in the leaves, stems, and flower buds, but the concentration varies. The female flowers typically contain the highest concentrations, while leaves and stems contain less4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Forms: \"Medical-grade\" cannabis products (such as edibles, butter, or waxes) are significantly more potent than the dried plant material. While the lethal dose for pets is generally considered high (noted as >3 g/kg for dogs), fatalities have been reported specifically after the ingestion of these highly concentrated medical-grade products45.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sensitivity: There is no official \"safe\" level of exposure; a small amount can affect one pet much more severely than another due to differences in age, health, and body size3.\nSources:\n\u2022 Cannabis (Marijuana) Intoxication in Cats and Dogs - VCA Animal Hospitals1...\n\u2022 Houseplants and Ornamentals Toxic to Animals - Merck Veterinary Manual4",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the symptoms of Cannabis / Marijuana (Cannabis sativa) intoxication in cats are primarily neurological, though they also affect the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. While the sources note that dogs have a higher density of cannabinoid receptors, cats are also susceptible to these toxic effects11.\n1. Incoordination and Disorientation (Ataxia)\n1. Symptom name: Ataxia (wobbly, uncoordinated movements) and Disorientation.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Signs manifest after the drug has been absorbed3.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The cat may appear \"drunk,\" wobbly, or unable to walk in a straight line. They may also be very vocal44.\n2. Altered Mental State (Sedation or Hyperactivity)\n1. Symptom name: Prolonged Depression (Sleepiness/Lethargy) or Hyperexcitability.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: After absorption3.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Reactions can range from extreme lethargy and sleepiness to hyperactivity and agitation44.\n3. Dilated Pupils (Mydriasis)\n1. Symptom name: Mydriasis (Dilated Pupils).\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Ocular.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: After absorption3.\n5. Additional clinical notes: This gives the cat a \"wild-eyed\" appearance44.\n4. Urinary Incontinence\n1. Symptom name: Urinary Incontinence (Urine Leakage).\n2. Affected body system: Renal / Neurological (loss of bladder control).\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: After absorption3.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The pet may dribble urine uncontrollably, a distinctive sign of cannabis intoxication4.\n5. Vomiting and Drooling\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting and Hypersalivation (Excessive Drooling).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: After absorption3.\n5. Additional clinical notes: While vomiting is a symptom, cannabis also has an anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) effect, which can make it difficult for veterinarians to induce vomiting as a treatment33.\n6. Heart Rate Abnormalities\n1. Symptom name: Bradycardia (Slow Heart Rate) or Tachycardia (Fast Heart Rate).\n2. Affected body system: Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: After absorption3.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Altered blood pressure is also observed alongside heart rate changes55.\n7. Abnormal Body Temperature\n1. Symptom name: Hypothermia (Low Body Temperature) or Hyperthermia (High Body Temperature).\n2. Affected body system: Neurological (Thermoregulation).\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: After absorption3.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Low body temperature is explicitly noted as a sign55.\n8. Severe Neurological Signs (Tremors, Seizures, Coma)\n1. Symptom name: Tremors, Seizures, and Coma.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: After absorption3.\n5. Additional clinical notes: While death is rare (\"seldom fatal\"), it can occur if vital central nervous system regulatory centers are severely depressed. Fatalities are more commonly associated with the ingestion of highly concentrated \"medical-grade\" products (e.g., edibles, waxes) rather than plant material44.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the veterinary treatments for Cannabis (Marijuana) intoxication in cats are listed below in order of priority. The prognosis is generally good, as cannabis intoxication is \"seldom fatal,\" though fatalities have occurred with high concentrations of medical-grade products1.\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination (Emesis or Gastric Lavage)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent, the veterinarian may attempt to induce vomiting (emesis) to remove the toxin from the stomach. In life-threatening cases, they may perform a gastric lavage (\"pumping the stomach\") to wash out the contents2.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the \"first line of defense,\" but it is time-sensitive. It is most effective if performed shortly after ingestion2. Two factors complicate this: clinical signs often manifest after the drug is already absorbed, and cannabis has a natural anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) effect, which can make it difficult for the vet to successfully induce vomiting2,3.\n\u2022 Sources:2,3\n2. Administration of Activated Charcoal\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of activated charcoal orally to bind to the toxin in the gastrointestinal tract, neutralizing it and preventing further absorption into the bloodstream2.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Charcoal may need to be administered every six to eight hours2. Oral tannic acid and saline cathartics (laxatives) are also recommended alongside charcoal to speed up the elimination of the toxin3. Enemas may also be used to reduce absorption from the intestinal tract2.\n\u2022 Sources:2,3\n3. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of fluids directly into the vein to maintain hydration and support physiological function4.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is a critical part of the \"second line of defense\" (supportive care)4. Because intoxicated cats may be extremely lethargic with no desire to drink, fluids are necessary to prevent dehydration, support blood pressure, and maintain organ function while the body metabolizes the drug4.\n\u2022 Sources:4\n4. Symptomatic Medication and Nursing Care\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The use of specific medications to manage symptoms such as heart rate abnormalities, respiratory distress, agitation, or nausea, combined with confinement in a safe environment4.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Medications: Respiratory or cardiac stimulants may be essential if the animal is severely depressed3. Anti-anxiety medications can minimize agitation, and gastrointestinal treatments can help with vomiting4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Environment: Cats should be confined in a safe, comfortable space to prevent self-trauma caused by disorientation and incoordination4. Noise should be kept to a minimum to decrease sensory stimulation4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Thermoregulation: Veterinary staff will monitor and treat irregular body temperatures (hypothermia or hyperthermia)4.\n\u2022 Sources:4,5,3"
