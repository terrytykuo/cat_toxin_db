Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, mistletoe (including American mistletoe, Phoradendron spp., and Viscum) contains several dangerous compounds that target a cat's gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems.\nHere are the specific toxic compounds found in mistletoe:\n1. Lectins and Viscotoxins (Toxic Proteins)\n1. Name of the compound: Lectins and viscotoxins (which are toxic proteins)1....\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: These toxic proteins act as severe gastrointestinal irritants and cardiovascular depressants1.... When ingested, they can cause profuse vomiting and diarrhea, dilated pupils, and rapid, labored breathing2. Systemically, they affect the heart, causing a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure, which can ultimately lead to shock and death from cardiovascular collapse1....\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: These toxins are found in all parts of the plant, though the leaves are considered to be more toxic than the berries14. While severe mistletoe toxicity is uncommon and usually requires a cat to eat a large amount of the plant, small ingestions are still potent enough to cause mild to severe stomach upset1....\n2. Phoratoxins\n1. Name of the compound: Phoratoxins13.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Working alongside the lectins, phoratoxins specifically target the heart muscle and cardiovascular system13. They are responsible for inducing dangerous drops in blood pressure (hypotension) and abnormally slow heart rates (bradycardia), which can lead to profound weakness and odd behavior3.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Phoratoxins are distributed throughout the plant1. Fortunately, a cat must typically consume a large amount of the plant for these chemicals to reach a severely toxic, life-threatening threshold3.\n3. Amines\n1. Name of the compound: Amines2.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Amines are present alongside the toxic proteins and contribute to the rapid onset of both gastrointestinal distress and cardiovascular shock2. They play a role in symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils, and labored breathing2.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Amines are found in all parts of the mistletoe plant2. Like the other compounds, a large toxic dose is generally required to trigger fatal cardiovascular collapse2.",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, mistletoe contains several toxic compounds, including lectins, phoratoxins, and viscotoxins1.... The leaves of the plant are generally considered more toxic than the berries1.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingesting mistletoe:\n1. Gastrointestinal Upset (Vomiting and Diarrhea)\n1. Symptom name: Gastrointestinal upset, including vomiting and diarrhea (which can be profuse).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Within hours of ingestion2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: If a cat only eats a small amount (like a few leaves or berries), the symptoms are typically limited to mild gastrointestinal irritation14. However, ingesting larger amounts leads to severe gastrointestinal distress56. Additionally, many store-bought mistletoe decorations use plastic berries; if a cat ingests a large amount of these fake berries, it can cause a physical gastrointestinal obstruction4.\n2. Cardiovascular Depression (Slowed Heart Rate and Low Blood Pressure)\n1. Symptom name: Slowed heart rate (bradycardia), low blood pressure (hypotension), and potential cardiovascular collapse1....\n2. Affected body system: Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Severe to fatal2.\n4. Typical onset time: Within hours of ingesting a toxic dose2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: These life-threatening cardiovascular effects are caused by the plant's lectins and phoratoxins3. Fortunately, severe heart toxicity is relatively uncommon and usually only occurs if the cat consumes a large amount of the plant34. If left untreated after a large ingestion, it can lead to shock and death from cardiovascular collapse2.\n3. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom name: Difficulty breathing or rapid, labored breathing23.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Within hours of ingesting a toxic dose2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This symptom is typically seen in severe cases of toxicity alongside cardiovascular collapse and shock23.\n4. Weakness, Odd Behavior, and Dilated Pupils\n1. Symptom name: Weakness, odd behavior, and dilated pupils23.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological and Systemic.\n3. Severity: Moderate to severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Within hours of ingestion2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: The profound weakness and lethargy a cat experiences are usually secondary effects caused by the significant drop in blood pressure and the slowed heart rate3.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources and our conversation history, there is no specific information detailing the recommended veterinary treatments for a cat that has ingested mistletoe.\n(Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it):\nBecause mistletoe contains dangerous lectins, viscotoxins, and phoratoxins that can cause severe gastrointestinal distress and life-threatening cardiovascular depression, veterinarians treat it as a medical emergency. Here are the standard recommended treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Medically Induced Emesis and Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: If the mistletoe was ingested recently, the veterinarian will administer medication to induce vomiting and clear the highly toxic leaves or berries from the stomach. After vomiting, they will administer activated charcoal to bind to any remaining toxins in the digestive tract and prevent them from being absorbed into the bloodstream.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is the most urgent step to prevent the toxins from triggering severe cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. You should never attempt to induce vomiting at home without direct veterinary supervision.\n2. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy\n1. Treatment name: IV Fluid Therapy and Blood Pressure Support.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The cat is placed on IV fluids to maintain hydration, support kidney function, and help flush the absorbed toxins out of the body.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because mistletoe poisoning can cause profuse vomiting and diarrhea\u2014as well as a dangerous drop in blood pressure (hypotension)\u2014aggressive fluid therapy is critical to prevent severe dehydration and cardiovascular collapse.\n3. Cardiovascular Monitoring and Pharmacological Support\n1. Treatment name: ECG Monitoring and Heart Medications (e.g., Atropine).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team will continuously monitor the cat's heart rhythm and blood pressure using an electrocardiogram (ECG). If the cat's heart rate drops dangerously low (bradycardia), the vet will administer specific cardiovascular drugs, such as atropine, to stabilize the heart rate.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This targeted treatment is necessary because the phoratoxins in mistletoe directly depress the cardiovascular system. Cats that have ingested a large amount of the plant are at the highest risk for requiring emergency heart stabilization.\n4. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: Anti-emetics and Oxygen Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will administer anti-emetic medications to stop severe nausea and vomiting. If the cat is experiencing respiratory distress, supplemental oxygen will be provided.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Even after the plant is removed from the stomach, the severe irritation to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract requires medical management to keep the cat comfortable and prevent further fluid loss."
