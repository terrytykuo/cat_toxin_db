List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, specific veterinary medical protocols (such as specific antidotes or dosages) for Angel's Trumpets (Brugmansia spp.) are not detailed. However, the sources emphasize that ingestion is a medical emergency requiring immediate professional intervention due to the severity of the symptoms affecting the heart and central nervous system.\nThe recommended course of action and supportive management priorities are:\n1. Immediate Veterinary Intervention\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Emergency Veterinary Consultation/Examination.\n\u2022 Brief Description: Seek veterinary care immediately if ingestion is suspected. Do not wait for symptoms to appear. The plant is noted to cause severe systemic effects that can escalate quickly.\n\u2022 Situation-Specific Notes: Angel's Trumpets produce beautiful blooms but are highly toxic. Although their strong odor often deters pets, ingestion still occurs and affects vital systems (heart and lungs).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Management of Hyperthermia\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Thermoregulation / Cooling Measures.\n\u2022 Brief Description: Veterinary staff will monitor and manage the cat's body temperature.\n\u2022 Situation-Specific Notes: One of the distinct symptoms of Angel's Trumpet poisoning is hyperthermia (elevated body temperature), which requires stabilization to prevent organ damage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n3. Cardiovascular and Respiratory Support\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Cardiac and Respiratory Monitoring.\n\u2022 Brief Description: Continuous monitoring of the heart rate and respiratory rate to manage instability.\n\u2022 Situation-Specific Notes: The toxins in the plant cause significant changes in heart rate and respiratory rate. Veterinary treatment will focus on stabilizing these vital signs to prevent fatal complications.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n4. Management of Neurological Symptoms\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Neurological Support / Seizure Precautions.\n\u2022 Brief Description: Managing behavioral changes and preventing injury due to disorientation.\n\u2022 Situation-Specific Notes: Cats may exhibit disorientation, dilated pupils, and behavioral changes due to the plant's effects on the central nervous system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\nImportant Note on \"Nightshade\" Confusion: While Angel's Trumpet belongs to the Solanaceae (Nightshade) family, it should not be confused with the \"Nightshade plants\" (like tomatoes and potatoes) described in other sources as containing solanine. Angel's Trumpets contain tropane alkaloids (though not explicitly named in the provided text, the symptoms of dilated pupils and hyperthermia are consistent with this). Treatments for solanine poisoning (such as using atropine) would be inappropriate and dangerous for Angel's Trumpet ingestion, which already presents with atropine-like effects (fast heart rate, dilated pupils). Therefore, rely strictly on the specific advice for Brugmansia or Angel's Trumpets: immediate veterinary care."
