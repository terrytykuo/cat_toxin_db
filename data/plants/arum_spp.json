Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Italian Arum (Arum spp.), also known as Black Calla or Cuckoopint, contains a specific, currently unidentified gastrointestinal toxin found throughout the entire plant.\n1. Mucous Membrane Irritation and Ulceration\n1. Symptom Name: Mucous Membrane Irritation and Ulcerations.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal (Oral and Esophageal Mucosa).\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe (Dose-dependent).\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (The irritation is a direct contact effect).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The toxin causes direct irritation to the tissues it touches. In severe cases or large ingestions, this irritation progresses to the formation of actual ulcers within the mouth and digestive tract.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Vomiting and Diarrhea\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting and Diarrhea.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (Following the irritation of the gastric lining).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: These are the primary systemic signs of ingestion. The severity of these symptoms is dose-dependent; larger ingestions result in more violent gastrointestinal clearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n3. Abdominal Discomfort\n1. Symptom Name: Abdominal Pain / Discomfort.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5.
