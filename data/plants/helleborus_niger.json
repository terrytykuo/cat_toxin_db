List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Christmas Rose (Helleborus niger) contains cardiac glycosides and irritating saps, making ingestion a potentially fatal medical emergency. Veterinary treatment focuses on stabilizing the heart, removing the toxins, and managing severe gastrointestinal distress.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Cardiac Stabilization and Antidote Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Antiarrhythmics, Atropine, or Digoxin-Specific Antibody Fragments.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may administer Atropine to treat a dangerously slow heart rate (bradycardia) or antiarrhythmic drugs (such as Lidocaine or Procainamide) to control irregular heartbeats. In severe cases, Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Fab) may be used as an antidote to bind and neutralize the cardiac toxins in the blood.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the most urgent priority because the cardiac glycosides in Christmas Rose can cause fatal arrhythmias and heart failure. The plant's toxins are structurally similar to the heart drug digoxin, allowing the specific antidote (Fab) to be effective.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Correction of Electrolyte Imbalances (Hyperkalemia)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Hyperkalemia Management (Insulin/Dextrose or Sodium Bicarbonate).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If blood tests reveal dangerously high potassium levels (hyperkalemia), the vet may administer insulin and dextrose (sugar) or sodium bicarbonate intravenously to drive potassium back into the cells and lower blood levels.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Cardiac glycosides inhibit the sodium-potassium cellular pumps, causing potassium to accumulate outside the cells. Severe hyperkalemia (> 7.5\u20139 mEq/L) is life-threatening and requires immediate correction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n3. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis and Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is stable and ingestion was recent, the vet may induce vomiting (emesis) to remove plant material. This is followed by the administration of activated charcoal, often in repeated doses (every 6\u20138 hours), to bind the toxins in the gut and prevent them from entering the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Repeated doses of charcoal are recommended because cardiac glycosides undergo enterohepatic recirculation (they are recycled through the liver and bile), meaning the body can re-absorb the toxin even after it has been processed once.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2\n4. Fluid Therapy and Symptomatic Support\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) Fluids and Gastroprotectants.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of IV fluids to maintain hydration and blood pressure, along with medications to stop vomiting (anti-emetics) and coat the stomach (gastroprotectants).\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: The saps in Christmas Rose are highly irritating and cause persistent vomiting and diarrhea, which may contain blood. Aggressive fluid support is necessary to prevent dehydration and support organ function while the severe irritation heals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2"
