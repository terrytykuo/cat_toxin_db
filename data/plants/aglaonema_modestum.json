Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema species, specifically Aglaonema modestum or Aglaonema commutatum) contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides). When a cat chews on the plant, these needle-like crystals are released into the soft tissues, causing immediate mechanical injury and irritation.\n1. Oral Irritation and Pain\n1. Symptom name: Intense burning, pain, and irritation of the mouth, tongue, and lips.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (Oral mucosa).\n3. Severity: Moderate (The immediate pain often prevents the cat from consuming large amounts).\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate (Pain occurs as soon as the plant tissue is chewed).\n5. Additional clinical notes: The plant contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals packaged in specialized cells (idioblasts) that forcefully eject into the tissue upon biting, causing micro-trauma. You may see the cat pawing at its mouth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4\n2. Hypersalivation\n1. Symptom name: Drooling or excessive salivation (Ptyalism).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate to within minutes of ingestion.\n5. Additional clinical notes: This is a reflex response to the intense irritation and burning sensation in the oral cavity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4\n3. Edema (Swelling)\n1. Symptom name: Swelling of the lips, tongue, and oral cavity.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal / Dermal (Oral tissues).\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid following contact.\n5. Additional clinical notes: In rare cases, swelling can extend to the pharynx (throat) or larynx (voice box). Severe swelling of the tongue or throat can potentially compromise the airway, though this is uncommon.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,4\n4. Dysphagia\n1. Symptom name: Difficulty swallowing.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal / Neurological (Functional impairment due to pain/swelling).\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The cat may show an inability to eat or drink due to the pain and swelling in the mouth and throat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1\n5. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting and anorexia (refusal to eat).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Shortly after ingestion.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Vomiting may occur due to the irritation of the stomach lining or the gag reflex triggered by oral swelling. The cat may refuse food (anorexia) simply because it hurts to chew and swallow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4\n6. Respiratory Distress (Rare)\n1. Symptom name: Dyspnea (Difficulty breathing).\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe (Potential medical emergency).\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (If laryngeal edema occurs).\n5. Additional clinical notes: While rare, if the swelling of the tongue or glottis is significant, it can obstruct the upper airway. This requires immediate veterinary intervention to secure an airway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema modestum) contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides). When a cat chews the plant, these needle-like crystals are released, causing immediate and painful mechanical irritation to the mouth and throat.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Airway Stabilization and Oxygen Support\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is experiencing respiratory distress, the veterinarian will immediately provide oxygen support. In severe cases where swelling (edema) obstructs the throat, they may need to secure an airway (intubation) to ensure the cat can breathe.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: While rare, laryngeal edema (swelling of the voice box and upper airway) can occur due to the inflammatory reaction caused by the crystals. This is a life-threatening complication that requires immediate intervention before other treatments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Oral Decontamination (Rinsing)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will physically remove any remaining plant material from the mouth and thoroughly rinse or wipe the oral cavity with cool water.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: The goal is to flush out the needle-like oxalate crystals causing the physical trauma. Rinsing helps reduce the immediate pain and prevents further embedding of the crystals in the soft tissues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,2\n3. Administration of Demulcents (Calcium-Containing Products)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of milk or other calcium-containing dairy products (like yogurt) to the cat.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Insoluble oxalates bind to the calcium found in dairy products. This reaction helps precipitate the crystals, aiding in their clearance from the oral cavity and esophagus while soothing the irritated mucous membranes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:2\n4. Symptomatic and Supportive Care (Fluids and Analgesics)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Fluid Therapy: Administration of subcutaneous or intravenous fluids if the cat is dehydrated or unable to drink due to mouth pain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Medications: Analgesics (pain relievers) and anti-inflammatories to manage oral swelling and discomfort. Gastroprotectants may be used if the stomach is irritated.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Most cases of Chinese Evergreen ingestion are self-limiting and have a good to excellent prognosis. Veterinary intervention is primarily needed to manage pain and hydration until the swelling subsides and the cat can eat and drink normally again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,4,2"
