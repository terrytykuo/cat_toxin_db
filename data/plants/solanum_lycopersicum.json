For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the toxic components in the Tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum) belong to the nightshade family's natural defense mechanisms.\nHere are the specific toxic compounds found in the tomato plant that harm cats:\n1. Tomatine and Solanine (Glycoalkaloids)\n1. Name of the compound: Glycoalkaloids, specifically tomatine and solanine1....\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources. (Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it: The chemical formula for tomatine is C\n50\n\t\u200b\n\nH\n83\n\t\u200b\n\nNO\n21\n\t\u200b\n\n and for solanine is C\n45\n\t\u200b\n\nH\n73\n\t\u200b\n\nNO\n15\n\t\u200b\n\n).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: These compounds act as cytotoxins and neurotoxins that disrupt a cat's body in three primary ways25:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cytotoxic Cell Destruction: The toxins interact with the phospholipids of the cell membranes, increasing their permeability and causing the cells to be destroyed5. This causes significant damage to the intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in severe gastrointestinal inflammation and irritation5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Neurological Overstimulation: The toxins inhibit acetylcholinesterase, a crucial enzyme in the brain responsible for breaking down acetylcholine6. This inhibition leads to a dangerous overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Mitochondrial Impairment: The glycoalkaloids disrupt the energy balance of the cells by inhibiting the cellular respiratory chain7.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The concentration of these toxins is exceptionally high in the green, vegetative parts of the plant (leaves and stems) as well as in the unripe, green fruit1.... As the tomato ripens and turns red, the toxin levels drop significantly to negligible amounts; ripe red tomatoes are largely harmless to cats, though consuming them in large quantities may still cause mild irritation1.... Furthermore, cats are much more sensitive to these toxins than dogs because feline livers lack the specific glucuronidation pathways needed to efficiently detoxify them, leading to prolonged and more severe poisoning910.\n2. Atropine\n1. Name of the compound: Atropine11.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources. (Please note that the following information is not from your sources: The chemical formula for atropine is C\n17\n\t\u200b\n\nH\n23\n\t\u200b\n\nNO\n3\n\t\u200b\n\n).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: The provided sources do not detail the specific biological mechanism of action for the atropine found in tomato plants11.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Atropine is noted to be present in tomatoes, but it is considered a \"lesser toxin\" compared to the highly concentrated tomatine11.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Emergency Stabilization (Respiratory, Cardiovascular, and Neurological Support)\n1. Treatment name: Oxygen Therapy, Defibrillation, and Anticonvulsant Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team will secure the airway to provide oxygen supplementation or mechanical ventilation, administer anticonvulsants (like benzodiazepines or barbiturates) to stop seizures, and use defibrillation if the heart experiences ventricular fibrillation12.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is the most urgent, life-saving intervention but is only required in the most severe, critical poisoning cases where the glycoalkaloids have progressed to cause respiratory depression, circulatory failure, or severe neurological impairment23.\n2. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Emesis Induction or Gastric Lavage.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will medically induce vomiting (often using xylazine for cats) to empty the stomach. Alternatively, they may perform a gastric lavage (pumping the stomach) under anesthesia4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This step is crucial for eliminating the toxic green plant parts or unripe fruit before the toxins can be absorbed, but it is typically only performed if the ingestion was recent (within 1 to 2 hours) and the cat is not yet showing severe symptoms4.\n3. Toxin Binding\n1. Treatment name: Administration of Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The cat is given a dose of activated charcoal (1\u20134 g/kg body weight) to bind to any unabsorbed solanine and tomatine remaining in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing the toxins from entering the bloodstream24.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: In cases of severe poisoning, the veterinarian may repeat the administration of activated charcoal multiple times at 4- to 6-hour intervals2.\n4. Systemic Support and Excretion\n1. Treatment name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Crystalloid IV fluids are administered to rehydrate the cat from fluid loss (due to vomiting and diarrhea), stimulate urine production (diuresis), and promote the excretion of the toxins2.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: In advanced poisoning cases where the toxins have caused the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), the IV infusion rate must be aggressively increased. This ensures adequate blood flow to the kidneys and prevents secondary kidney damage caused by the release of hemoglobin2.\n5. Pharmacological Symptom Management\n1. Treatment name: Atropine Administration.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian administers the medication atropine to help counteract the specific effects of the toxins on the nervous system25.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: While there is no direct antidote for solanine or tomatine poisoning, atropine is specifically utilized to treat \"cholinergic symptoms\" caused by the toxins, such as a dangerously slow heart rate (bradycardia) or excessive salivation2....",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nThe provided sources and our conversation history do not contain any information regarding the Tomato plant or its toxicity to cats.\n(Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it):\nWhile the ripe, red fruit of a tomato plant is generally considered non-toxic to cats, the green parts of the plant (the stems, leaves, and unripe green tomatoes) contain the toxic glycoalkaloids solanine and tomatine. If a cat ingests these green parts, they may show the following symptoms:\n1. Hypersalivation (Drooling)\n1. Symptom name: Hypersalivation (Drooling).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Within a few hours of ingestion.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is typically one of the first signs of oral and gastrointestinal irritation caused by the plant's glycoalkaloid toxins.\n2. Vomiting and Diarrhea\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting and diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Within a few hours of ingestion.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Solanine and tomatine act as direct gastrointestinal irritants. If the vomiting or diarrhea is severe, it can lead to dehydration.\n3. Lethargy and Weakness\n1. Symptom name: Lethargy, weakness, and confusion.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Progresses after gastrointestinal signs (usually within a few to several hours).\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is caused by the systemic absorption of solanine, which acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor and depresses the central nervous system.\n4. Dilated Pupils (Mydriasis)\n1. Symptom name: Dilated pupils (mydriasis).\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Mild to moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: A few hours after ingestion.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is an additional neurological effect stemming from the disruption of the nervous system by the glycoalkaloid toxins.\n5. Slowed Heart Rate (Bradycardia)\n1. Symptom name: Slowed heart rate (bradycardia).\n2. Affected body system: Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Occurs after the systemic absorption of a large toxic dose.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Severe cardiovascular and neurological effects are rare in cats. Felines typically do not consume enough of the unpalatable green plant material to trigger life-threatening symptoms, but it remains a risk in cases of severe poisoning.\nWould you like me to search the web for more information and sources regarding tomato plant toxicity in cats?
