What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, here is the information regarding the Corn Plant (Dracaena fragrans):\n1. Botanical Family The Corn Plant belongs to the Agavaceae family1.\n2. Brief Description\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Appearance: It is described as a robust, palm-like plant. It features lance-shaped, thin, alternate leaves that do not have petioles (stalks). The leaves are often variegated with yellow, red, or green stripes along the margins. As the plant matures, it loses its lower leaves, leaving behind clearly demarcated leaf scars on the stem, while retaining leaves at the top1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Where Commonly Found: It is widely kept as a houseplant and is valued for its decorative appearance12. It is sometimes referred to as a \"female dragon\"3.\nNote: While Dracaena species are often reclassified into the Asparagaceae family in modern botany, the provided veterinary and toxicology sources classify it under Agavaceae.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Corn Plant (Dracaena fragrans) contains saponins that cause gastrointestinal irritation and specific signs in cats like dilated pupils. Veterinary treatment is generally supportive and symptomatic, as the toxicity is usually moderate.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Oral Cleansing and Emesis)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Removal of Plant Material / Oral Decontamination.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian (or owner under guidance) should gently wipe out the cat's mouth to remove any remaining plant residue that may be causing local irritation. If the ingestion was very recent, the veterinarian may induce vomiting (emesis) to expel the plant material from the stomach before it is fully absorbed.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Wiping the mouth helps reduce oral pain and drooling. Inducing vomiting is a standard protocol for recent plant ingestion but should be performed by a professional to avoid aspiration, especially if the cat is already vomiting or lethargic.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Fluid Therapy (Rehydration)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) or Subcutaneous Fluid Administration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Fluids are administered to correct dehydration and stabilize electrolyte levels.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is critical because Corn Plant ingestion frequently causes vomiting (which may occasionally contain blood) and diarrhea, leading to significant fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,2,1\n3. Symptomatic Medication (Anti-emetics)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Anti-emetics and Gastroprotectants.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Medications are given to stop persistent vomiting (anti-emetics) and to coat or soothe the stomach lining (gastroprotectants) to relieve irritation.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Since the saponins in Dracaena plants cause gastrointestinal irritation, these medications help alleviate the primary symptoms of distress and prevent further damage to the esophagus from chronic vomiting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n4. Clinical Monitoring (Neurological Observation)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Observation for Systemic Signs.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team will monitor the cat for specific physiological changes until they resolve.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Cats specifically may exhibit dilated pupils, depression, incoordination, or weakness after ingesting Dracaena species. Close monitoring ensures these neurological and systemic signs subside along with the gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3"
