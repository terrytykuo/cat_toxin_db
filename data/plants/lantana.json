List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Lantana (Lantana camara) is extremely toxic to cats and contains pentacyclic triterpenoids which can lead to liver failure and severe gastrointestinal distress.\nWhile specific drug protocols exclusively for Lantana are not detailed in isolation within the text, veterinary treatment for hepatotoxic (liver-damaging) and toxic plant ingestion follows a standard urgent protocol.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting) and Gastric Lavage.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion is recent (typically within 1\u20132 hours) and the cat is neurologically stable, the veterinarian will administer medication (such as xylazine) to induce vomiting and remove the plant material from the stomach. In life-threatening cases or if vomiting cannot be induced safely, the stomach may be pumped (gastric lavage) to wash out contents.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Decontamination is most effective when performed early. Owners should not attempt to induce vomiting at home with hydrogen peroxide or salt, as this can cause severe injury; this procedure requires veterinary supervision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Toxin Adsorption\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Following emesis, the veterinarian administers activated charcoal, often with a cathartic. This substance binds to the remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing them from being absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because some plant toxins undergo \"enterohepatic recirculation\" (recycling through the liver), multiple doses of activated charcoal every 6\u20138 hours may be necessary to minimize ongoing liver damage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4,5\n3. Hepatic and Systemic Support\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: IV fluids are administered to maintain hydration, correct electrolyte imbalances caused by vomiting and diarrhea, and support organ function by flushing toxins from the body.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Since Lantana toxicity can lead to liver failure, maintaining adequate perfusion to the liver and kidneys is critical. Fluid therapy helps manage the hypotension (low blood pressure) and dehydration often associated with severe plant poisoning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:6,4,5\n4. Symptomatic Care and Monitoring\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Hepatoprotectants and Anti-emetics.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Veterinarians may administer liver-protecting medications (such as SAMe or N-acetylcysteine) to support liver repair. Medications to stop vomiting (anti-emetics) and protect the stomach lining (gastroprotectants) are used to treat severe gastrointestinal upset.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Lantana ingestion can cause labored breathing and weakness; therefore, continuous monitoring of vital signs and liver enzymes is essential to assess the progression of toxicity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:6,7,8"
