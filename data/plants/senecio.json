What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nThe provided sources mention the String of Pearls (Senecio) to note that it is a popular houseplant, but they do not provide details regarding its botanical family, physical appearance, or natural habitat1.\nI can provide the answers to your questions using information from outside of the given sources (please note that this information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it):\n1. Botanical Family String of Pearls (Senecio rowleyanus, which was also recently reclassified as Curio rowleyanus) belongs to the Asteraceae (daisy or sunflower) family.\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: The String of Pearls is a unique, trailing succulent. It is easily recognizable by its long, cascading, thin stems adorned with small, spherical, fleshy green leaves that resemble peas or small pearls. The plant occasionally blooms with small, white, brush-like flowers that are known to smell faintly of cinnamon.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to the dry, arid, and semi-desert regions of southwestern Africa (primarily South Africa and Namibia), its trailing stems typically grow low along the ground in the wild, taking root where they touch the soil and forming dense, creeping mats to avoid direct, harsh sunlight. Today, it is most commonly found worldwide as a highly popular ornamental indoor houseplant, frequently displayed in hanging baskets so its string-like stems can dramatically cascade over the edges.",

(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, all parts of the String of Pearls plant (Senecio) are considered toxic to cats, with the leaves and sap specifically noted as the hazardous parts1.\nAdditionally, the plant's sap is known to be a topical irritant that can cause irritation to a cat's skin and eyes upon contact1.",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the exact toxic compound in the String of Pearls (Senecio) is not definitively known, but there is a suspected class of toxins responsible for its effects on cats. Here are the details:\n1. Suspected Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids (and Irritant Sap)\n1. Name of the compound: The exact toxin is listed as \"Unknown,\" but it is suspected to be pyrrolizidine alkaloids1. The plant also contains an unidentified irritant in its sap1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: The sources do not detail the specific internal biological mechanism of the suspected alkaloids. However, they note that the plant's sap acts as a direct topical irritant that can inflame a cat's skin and eyes upon contact1. Internally, ingestion disrupts the gastrointestinal system and causes systemic depression, resulting in drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy1.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The toxicity of the String of Pearls plant is considered to be of \"moderate\" severity1. While a small exposure may cause mild upset, ingesting a large amount of the plant is more potent and can cause the cat to become significantly lethargic, which requires veterinary attention1.",
