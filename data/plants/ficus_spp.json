Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Ficus plants (including the Weeping Fig, Ficus benjamina) contain a poisonous milky sap composed of several toxic compounds.\n1. Proteolytic Enzymes (Ficin)\n1. Name of the compound: Proteolytic Enzymes (specifically identified as Ficin in related Ficus species).\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly provided in the sources (Enzymes are complex proteins).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Irritation: These enzymes break down proteins. When the sap contacts the cat's skin or mucous membranes (mouth), it causes significant irritation and inflammation. This leads to contact dermatitis on the skin and gastrointestinal signs like vomiting and drooling if ingested.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Found within the milky sap present in the leaves and stems.\nSources:1,2\n2. Psoralens (Furocoumarins)\n1.

Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Ficus plants (including the Weeping Fig, Ficus benjamina, as well as Rubber Plants and Fiddle Leaf Figs) contain a toxic milky sap in their stems and leaves. This sap contains proteolytic enzymes (like ficin) and psoralens (furocoumarins) which are irritating to tissue.\n1. Dermal Irritation (Contact Dermatitis)\n1. Symptom Name: Contact Dermatitis (Skin redness, irritation, or swelling).\n2. Affected Body System: Dermal (Skin).\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (Upon contact with the sap).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The milky sap found throughout the plant can cause redness, itchiness, and irritation if it touches the cat's skin. This is a distinguishing feature of Ficus toxicity compared to many other houseplants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting and Diarrhea.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (Shortly after ingestion).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Ingestion of the leaves or stems introduces the irritating sap to the stomach, leading to vomiting and loose stools. While uncomfortable, these symptoms are generally self-limiting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n3. Oral Irritation and Hypersalivation\n1. Symptom Name: Excessive Drooling (Hypersalivation) and Oral Pain.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal (Oral).\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Immediate (Upon chewing).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The proteolytic enzymes (ficin) in the sap break down proteins and irritate the mucous membranes of the mouth, causing the cat to drool excessively or paw at its mouth due to the burning sensation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Ficus plants (including Weeping Fig, Rubber Plants, and Fiddle Leaf Figs) contain a toxic milky sap with proteolytic enzymes and psoralens that cause irritation. Treatment is primarily focused on decontamination and managing symptoms, as the toxicity is usually mild to moderate.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Oral and Dermal)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Physical Decontamination (Rinsing and Washing).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Immediate removal of the plant's irritating milky sap is the first step. This involves rinsing the cat's mouth with water to dilute the sap and wiping away any sap present on the lips or tongue. If sap has gotten onto the cat's fur or skin, it must be washed off (often with mild soap) to prevent contact dermatitis and further ingestion through grooming.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: The sap contains proteolytic enzymes (ficin) and psoralens which cause immediate burning, irritation, and potentially dermatitis upon contact. Quick removal helps minimize this pain and skin redness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Home Monitoring and Hydration\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Observation and Fluid Support.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: After decontamination, the cat is offered water to help soothe the mouth and maintain hydration. Owners are instructed to monitor the cat closely for signs of escalating distress, such as persistent vomiting or refusal to eat.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because Ficus toxicity is often mild, many cases resolve with simple home care. This step effectively manages the minor gastrointestinal upset (nausea) that follows ingestion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n3. Symptomatic Medical Management\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Supportive Care (Anti-emetics and Fluid Therapy).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea are severe or persistent, a veterinarian will administer medications to stop the vomiting (anti-emetics), protect the stomach lining (gastroprotectants), and provide subcutaneous or intravenous fluids to correct electrolyte imbalances.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This treatment is reserved for cats showing significant discomfort, dehydration, or symptoms that do not resolve on their own after the initial exposure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3"
