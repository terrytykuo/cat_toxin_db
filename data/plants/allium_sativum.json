N-Propyl Disulfide (and other sulfur compounds)\n1. Name of the compound: N-propyl disulfide (part of a group of sulfur compounds found in Allium species).\n2.

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Garlic (Allium sativum) is highly toxic to cats, considered approximately five times more potent than onions. The primary danger lies in its ability to damage red blood cells, leading to a delay in the onset of the most severe symptoms.\n1. Hemolytic Anemia\n1. Symptom Name: Hemolytic Anemia (Heinz Body Anemia).\n2. Affected Body System: Hematological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Delayed (Signs may not appear for several days after ingestion).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Garlic contains sulfur compounds that cause oxidative damage to red blood cells, leading to their destruction (hemolysis). This results in a dangerously low red blood cell count, preventing adequate oxygen transport throughout the body.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Abdominal Pain.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Delayed (Can appear several days later along with other symptoms, though mucosal irritation may occur earlier).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The plant compounds irritate the gastrointestinal mucosa. While vomiting can be an early sign of irritation, it is often listed alongside the delayed systemic effects of poisoning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3\n3. Discolored Mucous Membranes\n1. Symptom Name: Pale, White, or Yellow (Jaundiced) Gums/Skin.\n2. Affected Body System: Hematological / Dermal.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Delayed (Several days).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Pale or white gums indicate severe anemia and blood loss. Yellow mucous membranes (jaundice) occur due to the breakdown of red blood cells releasing bilirubin into the system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n4. Dark or Discolored Urine\n1. Symptom Name: Hemoglobinuria (Red to Brown Urine).\n2. Affected Body System: Renal / Hematological.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Delayed.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The urine turns dark red or brown due to the presence of hemoglobin filtered from the destroyed red blood cells.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n5. General Weakness and Collapse\n1. Symptom Name: Lethargy, Weakness, Stumbling (Ataxia), and Collapse.\n2. Affected Body System: Neurological / Musculoskeletal (secondary to hypoxia).\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Delayed (Several days).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The cat may appear uncoordinated, tired, or unable to stand due to the lack of oxygen reaching the muscles and brain. Cats may also seek out warm spaces.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n6. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom Name: Tachypnea (Rapid Breathing) or Difficulty Breathing.\n2. Affected Body System: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Delayed (Several days).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The cat breathes rapidly in an attempt to compensate for the decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3\n7. Tachycardia\n1. Symptom Name: Rapid Heartbeat (Tachycardia).\n2. Affected Body System: Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Delayed (Several days).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The heart beats faster to try to pump the remaining oxygenated blood to vital organs more efficiently.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Garlic (Allium sativum) contains sulfur compounds that cause oxidative damage to red blood cells (Heinz body anemia), leading to their destruction (hemolysis). Because the clinical signs of anemia can be delayed for several days, early veterinary intervention is critical even if the cat appears normal immediately after ingestion.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting) and Administration of Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion is recent, the veterinarian will administer medication to induce vomiting and remove the garlic from the stomach. This is typically followed by activated charcoal to bind any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and prevent them from entering the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Owners should not attempt to induce vomiting at home (e.g., using hydrogen peroxide), as this can cause severe injury to the cat's stomach and throat. Professional induction is safer and more effective.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Supportive Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: IV fluids are administered to maintain hydration and support organ function. This is particularly important to flush the kidneys, as the destruction of red blood cells releases hemoglobin (hemoglobinuria), which can darken the urine and potentially damage the kidneys.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Fluids also help manage the immediate gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea often associated with plant poisoning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3\n3. Hematological Monitoring and Oxygen Support\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Blood Count Monitoring and Oxygen Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will monitor the cat's blood work (specifically packed cell volume and red blood cell count) to track the severity of the anemia. If the anemia becomes severe and limits oxygen delivery to tissues, oxygen therapy or a blood transfusion may be required to stabilize the patient.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Garlic toxicity is characterized by a delayed onset; symptoms like pale gums, rapid breathing, and lethargy may not appear for several days after ingestion. Therefore, observation and follow-up blood work are crucial even if the cat initially seems fine.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,2,5"
