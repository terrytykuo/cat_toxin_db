Botanical Family It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae1.\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: It grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree1. Its leaves are alternate, thick, somewhat leathery, lustrous, and have smooth (toothless) edges1. It is a winter-blooming plant that produces large, showy, and sometimes fragrant funnel-shaped flowers with five petals and a 5-lobed tubular calyx1. After flowering, it produces berry-like capsules1.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: The provided sources do not detail its specific geographic habitat, but they note that it is commonly found in domestic settings cultivated as a poisonous houseplant or ornamental shrub12.\n(Please note that the following information regarding its habitat is not from your sources, and you may want to independently verify it: The plant is originally native to the woodlands of Brazil. It thrives in warm, subtropical, and tropical climates, and it is widely cultivated globally in gardens and greenhouses. It gets its unique common name because its blooms open as a deep purple, fade to a pale lavender the next day, and turn white on the third day).",

Name of the compound: Atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: The sources do not detail the exact cellular mechanism of action for these specific toxins. However, they act systemically to cause severe physiological and neurological disruption. Once ingested, they trigger an abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia), dry mouth, dilated pupils, loss of coordination (ataxia), tremors, urinary retention, depression, and sometimes deep sedation or coma1.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: These toxic alkaloids are found throughout the plant, specifically located within the flowers, leaves, bark, and roots1. While they are potent enough to cause severe clinical depression requiring respiratory and cardiac stimulants to treat, poisoning from this plant is notably not reported to be fatal1.",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the plant Yesterday-today-and-tomorrow (Brunfelsia pauciflora floribunda) contains toxic alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine) that can cause profound neurological and physiological issues, including deep sedation or coma12.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments based on the sources, listed in order of priority for a severely affected cat:\n1. Respiratory and Cardiac Stimulants\n1. Treatment name: Administration of Respiratory and Cardiac Stimulants.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian administers specific stimulant medications to support and revive the cat's cardiovascular and respiratory systems2.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is the most urgent intervention and is specifically recommended if the cat has become severely depressed, heavily sedated, or has slipped into a coma as a result of the poisoning12.\n2. Supportive Treatment\n1. Treatment name: General Supportive Care.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team provides ongoing symptom management and monitoring to stabilize the cat until the toxins clear its system2.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because the plant can cause a wide variety of systemic issues\u2014such as an abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia), urinary retention, tremors, and loss of coordination (ataxia)\u2014supportive care is essential and will be tailored to the specific symptoms the cat is actively experiencing12. Fortunately, the sources note that poisoning from this plant is not reported to cause death12."
