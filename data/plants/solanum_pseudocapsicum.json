Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Jerusalem Cherry (Solanum pseudocapsicum) contains toxic alkaloids (solanocapsine) that can cause severe gastrointestinal, neurological, and circulatory issues. Veterinary treatment is symptomatic and supportive, as there is no specific antidote.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Gastric Lavage (Stomach Pumping).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian inserts a tube into the cat's stomach to wash out contents and remove unabsorbed plant material.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is explicitly suggested to remove the toxic alkaloids from the system before they can be fully absorbed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Toxin Adsorption\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: A substance is administered orally to bind with the remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing them from entering the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This step typically follows decontamination to minimize the bioavailability of the ingested alkaloids.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n3. Supportive Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Fluid and Electrolyte Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Intravenous (IV) fluids and electrolytes are administered to correct dehydration and imbalances caused by severe vomiting and diarrhea.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This treatment is crucial for managing circulatory collapse (shock) and hemorrhagic diarrhea, both of which are potential severe symptoms of Jerusalem Cherry poisoning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n4. Neurological Management\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Anticonvulsants.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Medications are given to control or prevent seizures and convulsions.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is necessary if the cat exhibits severe neurological signs, such as convulsions, which are documented effects of the plant's toxins.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1"
