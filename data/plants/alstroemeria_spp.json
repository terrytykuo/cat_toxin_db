(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the exact anatomical parts of the Peruvian Lily (Alstroemeria species) that are toxic to cats are not explicitly specified.\nHowever, the sources do provide the following information regarding its toxicity:\n\u2022 Whole Plant/Bouquets: Peruvian lilies are frequently found in floral bouquets, and ingesting the plant generally causes mild, self-limiting stomach upset1.\n\u2022 Toxin Type: One source notes that Peruvian lilies (along with Peace and Calla lilies) contain oxalate crystals, which are responsible for these minor signs of toxicity2.\nImportant Clinical Note: The Peruvian Lily is an \"imposter lily\"3. Unlike \"true lilies\" (Lilium species), which are deadly and can cause acute kidney failure from even a tiny bite of any plant part, the Peruvian Lily is only mildly toxic and does not cause kidney failure in cats1.",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Oxalate Crystals\n1. Name of the compound: Oxalate crystals1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: The oxalate crystals act as direct physical irritants1. When a cat chews or swallows the plant material, the crystals irritate the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in minor signs of toxicity such as mild, self-limiting stomach upset12. Because the Peruvian Lily (Alstroemeria spp.) is considered an \"imposter lily\" and not a true lily, these crystals do not cause the acute, fatal kidney failure associated with true lily ingestions23.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The overall toxicity and potency of the Peruvian Lily are considered very mild12. Interestingly, the Peruvian Lily was listed among the top 10 cat exposure calls to the Pet Poison Helpline in 2023; this is largely because it is incredibly common in floral bouquets and the name \"lily\" causes immediate panic for cat owners24. However, actual poisoning is minor, and the resulting stomach upset generally resolves on its own2.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Peruvian Lily (Alstroemeria spp.) is considered an \"imposter lily\" and does not cause the fatal kidney failure associated with true lilies12. It contains oxalate crystals that result in only minor signs of toxicity3.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingesting or being exposed to a Peruvian Lily:\n1. Stomach Upset\n1. Symptom name: Stomach upset (vomiting and/or diarrhea).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources, but generally occurs shortly after ingestion.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: The stomach upset caused by Peruvian lilies is considered minor and self-limiting13. Because Peruvian lilies are not \"true\" lilies, they do not cause acute kidney failure, and actual poisoning is rare despite the plant's frequent appearance in floral bouquets1.\n2. Minor Oral Irritation\n1. Symptom name: Minor signs of oral toxicity or irritation.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (specifically the oral cavity).\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate to shortly after chewing the plant.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This minor irritation is caused by the oxalate crystals present in the plant, which act as a physical irritant when the cat chews on the plant material3.",
    "treatments": "\ud83d\udcda Loaded library with 1 notebooks\n\u26a0\ufe0f Browser state is 9.8 days old, may need re-authentication\n\ud83d\udcac Asking: What are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests Peruvian Lily?

Cite your sources.\n\ud83d\udcda Notebook: https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/9ef4df26-178b-446d-8e9d-e57cbe878a0d\n  \ud83c\udf10 Opening notebook...\n  \u23f3 Waiting for query input...\n  \u2713 Found input: textarea.query-box-input\n  \u23f3 Typing question...\n  \ud83d\udce4 Submitting...\n  \u23f3 Waiting for answer...\n  \u2705 Got answer!\n\n============================================================\nQuestion: What are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests Peruvian Lily? List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBecause the Peruvian Lily (Alstroemeria species) is an \"imposter lily\" and not a true lily, it does not cause fatal kidney failure12. Instead, it contains oxalate crystals that cause minor, self-limiting signs of toxicity, such as mild stomach upset or oral irritation23. Because of this, aggressive interventions like dialysis or intensive IV fluid diuresis are unnecessary4. Most cases have an excellent prognosis and resolve without any veterinary intervention4.\nHowever, if veterinary care is required due to discomfort or rare complications from the oxalate crystals, the recommended treatments, prioritized from most urgent to general care, include:\n1. Airway Management and Oxygen Support\n1. Treatment name: Securing an Airway and Oxygen Support.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will monitor the cat for severe tissue swelling in the throat (laryngeal edema) caused by the irritation of the crystals. If the swelling obstructs breathing, the vet will secure the airway and provide supplemental oxygen4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is an emergency measure that is rarely necessary, but it is the most critical priority if severe swelling occurs4.\n2. Oral Decontamination and Crystal Binding\n1. Treatment name: Removal of Plant Material and Oral Rinsing.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The mouth is wiped out to physically remove any remaining plant material4. The oral cavity is then rinsed with water to help clear away the sharp oxalate crystals (raphides)4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Veterinarians may utilize milk or other calcium-containing dairy products, as the calcium binds directly to the insoluble oxalates, which helps clear them from the mouth and esophagus and eases the cat's pain4.\n3. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: General Supportive Care and Monitoring.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The cat is observed for mild, self-limiting stomach upset, excessive drooling, or oral pain24. Basic supportive care is provided until the irritation naturally subsides24.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because Peruvian lilies only cause mild, localized irritation, there is no concern for systemic organ injury or renal failure24. Full recovery is expected, and many cats recover completely at home without requiring a clinic visit4."
