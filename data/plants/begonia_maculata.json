For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Calcium Oxalates (Oxalic Acid)\n1. Name of the compound: Calcium oxalates. (Note: The provided sources have slightly conflicting classifications, with some identifying the toxin as soluble calcium oxalates12, others as insoluble oxalate crystals3, and another stating the plant contains \"oxalate\" that breaks down into oxalic acid when ingested4).\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: The oxalates act as an immediate and intense physical and chemical irritant5. When a cat bites or chews the plant, it causes an unpleasant burning sensation and irritation in the mouth and throat, leading to excessive drooling, difficulty swallowing, and vomiting3.... If a large enough amount of the toxin is digested and makes its way into the cat's bloodstream, it can travel to the liver and cause severe illness, including liver failure4. (Note: In large grazing animals, soluble oxalates are noted to cause kidney failure16.)\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The overall toxicity of the plant is generally classified as mild to moderate for cats36. The toxins are present throughout the entire plant, but they are most highly concentrated in the underground structures\u2014specifically the roots, tubers, and rhizomes1.... Fortunately, because the very first bite produces such an immediate and painful burning sensation in the mouth, cats are usually deterred from eating large quantities, making fatal or severe poisonings rare5.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Polka Dot Begonia (Begonia maculata) contains oxalates that cause irritation and potential systemic issues if ingested. Here are the symptoms a cat may exhibit after exposure:\n1. Intense Oral Irritation and Drooling\n1. Symptom name: Excessive drooling (hypersalivation), redness around the mouth, oral sores, excessive licking of the lips, and an unpleasant burning sensation12.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (specifically the oral cavity).\n3. Severity: Mild3.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This immediate irritation is caused by the calcium oxalates within the plant. Because the very first bite produces such an unpleasant and painful sensation in the mouth and throat, cats are usually deterred from taking more than one bite1.\n2. Difficulty Swallowing\n1. Symptom name: Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)24.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild35.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate to shortly after chewing.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is a direct physical response to the intense irritation, pain, and potential swelling in the mouth and throat caused by the plant's toxins12.\n3. Gastrointestinal Distress and Anorexia\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, disinterest in food and water (anorexia), and difficulty eating23.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild35.\n4. Typical onset time: Shortly after ingestion.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: The cat will often vomit to rid its stomach of the irritating plant material6. In most cases, these symptoms are relatively mild and naturally clear up within about two days5. However, if the cat persistently refuses water, a veterinarian may need to administer intravenous (IV) fluids to treat dehydration5.\n4. Systemic Illness and Liver Failure\n1. Symptom name: Serious illness and liver failure6.\n2. Affected body system: Hepatic.\n3. Severity: Severe6.\n4. Typical onset time: Delayed (occurs after the toxins are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream).\n5. Any additional clinical notes: While the leaves and flowers usually only cause mild stomach upset, the roots and tubers contain the highest concentration of oxalates2. If a cat manages to ingest a large amount of these highly toxic underground parts, the substance breaks down into oxalic acid, makes its way into the bloodstream, and travels to the liver where it can cause severe, life-threatening damage26.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n\ud83d\udcda Notebook: https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/9ef4df26-178b-446d-8e9d-e57cbe878a0d\n  \ud83c\udf10 Opening notebook...\n  \u23f3 Waiting for query input...\n  \u2713 Found input: textarea.query-box-input\n  \u23f3 Typing question...\n  \ud83d\udce4 Submitting...\n  \u23f3 Waiting for answer...\n  \u2705 Got answer!\n\n============================================================\nQuestion: What are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests Polka Dot Begonia? List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Oral Rinsing and Dilution\n1. Treatment name: Oral Rinsing and Dilution.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Providing the cat with water or milk to help rinse out the mouth and wash away the irritating plant material.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is an immediate, first-line step to help relieve the intense burning sensation, oral pain, and drooling caused by the oxalates in the plant1.\n2. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Emesis Induction and Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may medically induce vomiting to empty the stomach, followed by administering a dose of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind unabsorbed toxins in the digestive tract.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because begonias contain soluble oxalates, this procedure is indicated if the cat has ingested more than just a small taste or nibble (especially the highly toxic roots or tubers) to prevent the toxins from being absorbed into the bloodstream23.\n3. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy and Calcium Correction\n1. Treatment name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Injecting fluids directly into the cat's veins for 24 to 48 hours to rehydrate the body, flush the system, and support organ function.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is critical if the cat is refusing water due to throat pain or is suffering from dehydration due to vomiting4. Furthermore, if a large amount of soluble oxalates was ingested, the toxins can bind to the body's calcium and cause a dangerous drop in calcium levels (hypocalcemia); in these severe cases, the vet will also administer intravenous calcium gluconate3.\n4. Systemic Diagnostics and Monitoring\n1. Treatment name: Physical Examination and Blood Tests.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will perform a full physical examination and run blood work to assess and monitor the cat's internal organ health.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: While begonia poisoning from leaves is typically mild, if the cat ingested the highly concentrated roots or tubers, the oxalates can break down into oxalic acid, enter the bloodstream, and cause severe systemic illness, including liver failure and kidney damage3....\n5. Gastrointestinal Rest and Dietary Management\n1. Treatment name: Mild Diet Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Feeding the cat a bland, mild diet for several days following the exposure.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This allows any irritation and swelling in the cat's throat and digestive system to heal4. Most mild cases of begonia poisoning clear up within about two days4."
