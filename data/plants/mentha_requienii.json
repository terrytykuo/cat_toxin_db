List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Corsican Mint (Mentha requienii) contains essential oils that are toxic to cats, potentially causing vomiting, lethargy, and gastrointestinal distress. While many ingestions result in mild symptoms that may not require aggressive treatment, severe cases or large ingestions require veterinary intervention.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastric Decontamination (Emesis or Gastric Lavage)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Vomiting or Stomach Pumping.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may administer medication to induce vomiting (emesis) to expel the plant material from the stomach. In more severe cases, or if the cat cannot vomit safely, a gastric lavage (stomach pump) may be performed to wash out the stomach contents.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is typically the first line of defense if the ingestion was recent. While one source mentions hydrogen peroxide, other veterinary authorities warn that you should never attempt to induce vomiting in cats at home using hydrogen peroxide, as it can cause severe injury; this procedure should only be performed by a veterinarian.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Toxin Adsorption (Activated Charcoal)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may administer a dose of activated charcoal. This substance works by binding to the toxic essential oils remaining in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing them from being absorbed into the cat's bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is often used following decontamination (vomiting) to neutralize any remaining toxins in the system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:2\n3. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Supportive Fluid Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Fluids are administered directly into the vein (IV) to rehydrate the cat and balance electrolytes.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is crucial if the cat has experienced excessive vomiting or diarrhea\u2014common symptoms of mint poisoning\u2014which can lead to dangerous dehydration. It helps stabilize the animal while they recover.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n4. Symptomatic Medication (Anti-emetics and Gastroprotectants)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Anti-nausea Medication and Stomach Protectants.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The vet may administer injections to stop nausea (anti-emetics) and medications (gastroprotectants) to coat and soothe the stomach lining.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Mint essential oils can relax the esophageal valve, making vomiting more likely and potentially irritating the stomach lining. These medications help stop the cycle of vomiting and reduce gastrointestinal pain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2"
