Typical onset time: Not specified in the provided sources (typically occurs upon contact).\n5. Additional clinical notes: This plant is distinct from other toxic plants because significant symptoms often arise simply from the cat brushing against the feathery leaves, which causes inflammation and irritation of the skin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2.

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Asparagus Fern (Asparagus densiflorus, also known as foxtail fern or emerald fern) causes toxicity primarily through skin contact (allergic dermatitis) and ingestion of the berries, which leads to gastrointestinal upset.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Dermal Decontamination (Bathing)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Thoroughly bathing the cat using lukewarm water and a mild liquid dish soap (like Dawn) to remove plant sap or resin from the skin and fur.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This plant is well-known for causing allergic dermatitis (skin irritation) when a cat simply brushes against it. Prompt removal of the irritant prevents further discomfort, redness, and swelling. It also stops the cat from ingesting more toxins while grooming itself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Symptomatic Supportive Care (Gastrointestinal Management)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of veterinary-prescribed medications such as antiemetics (to control vomiting), antidiarrheals, and potentially gastroprotectants. A bland diet may also be recommended to soothe the stomach.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Ingesting the berries or leaves of the Asparagus Fern typically causes vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Treatment focuses on managing these symptoms until the toxins pass through the system, usually within 24 hours.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,2\n3. Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Administration of subcutaneous or intravenous fluids to restore hydration and electrolyte balance.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is necessary if the cat experiences persistent vomiting or diarrhea leading to dehydration. Fluid support helps maintain organ function while the cat recovers from the gastrointestinal distress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,1"
