What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Botanical Family Based on the provided sources, the botanical family of Wisteria is not mentioned. (Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it: Wisteria belongs to the pea or legume family, Fabaceae).\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: Wisteria is a vigorous climbing plant (vine) that requires physical support to grow1. It is most famous for its stunning, pendant (hanging) flower blooms that are often sweetly scented and can range in color from purple to white and pink2. After the flowers bloom, the plant produces seeds enclosed in pods34.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Wisteria is originally native to parts of Asia and the United States2. Today, it is highly prized for its aesthetic appeal and is cultivated in gardens around the globe as a decorative ornamental plant2.",

(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nThe entire Wisteria plant is considered toxic to cats, but the concentration of toxins varies significantly depending on the specific part of the plant12.\n\u2022 Seeds and Seed Pods: These are by far the most highly toxic parts of the plant1....\n\u2022 Bark, Leaves, Flowers, and Stems: While these parts are also poisonous and can cause gastrointestinal upset if a cat nibbles or chews on them, they contain lower concentrations of the toxins compared to the seeds and pods3....",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Lectins\n1. Name of the compound: Lectins (specifically noted as irritant lectins)12.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources (Please note that lectins are complex proteins, so they do not have a simple chemical formula like smaller molecules do).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Lectins act as severe gastrointestinal irritants. When ingested by a cat, they trigger intense stomach pain, nausea, profuse vomiting (which may contain blood), and diarrhea2.... This massive gastrointestinal distress can subsequently lead to severe dehydration, central nervous system damage, and collapse15.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: While lectins are present in all parts of the wisteria plant, they have the highest toxic concentration in the seeds and seed pods, making those parts by far the most dangerous1....\n2. Wisterin\n1. Name of the compound: Wisterin (identified as a toxic glycoside)13.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Working alongside the plant's lectins, wisterin is a poisonous compound that contributes to severe systemic illness. It causes drastic gastrointestinal upset, including abdominal pain, bloody vomiting, and diarrhea14. If a cat ingests a large amount, the toxicity can escalate to fatal dehydration, central nervous system damage, and physical collapse1....\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Like lectins, wisterin is found throughout the entire plant\u2014including the leaves, bark, and flowers\u2014but it is most potently concentrated in the plant's seeds and pods1.... Ingesting the seeds and pods can be fatal to small animals like cats4.",

Any additional clinical notes: These systemic and neurological symptoms manifest primarily when a cat ingests larger amounts of the plant, particularly the highly concentrated and deadly seeds and seed pods [395, 770, 849, Conversation History]. If left untreated, the severe dehydration and toxicity can be fatal to cats [395, 800, Conversation History].",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources and our conversation history, here are the recommended treatments if a cat ingests Wisteria, listed in order of priority:\n1. Immediate Oral Decontamination (At-Home First Aid)\n1. Treatment name: Oral Decontamination and Plant Removal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Gently remove any remaining plant material (especially the highly toxic seeds or pods) from the cat's mouth. Rinse the mouth and offer small sips of water1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: It is highly advised not to induce vomiting at home unless specifically directed to do so by a veterinary professional. Do not give the cat any food or medications without veterinary instruction. If possible, bring a sample of the wisteria plant to the clinic to help the vet confirm the poisoning1.\n2. Gastrointestinal Decontamination (Veterinary)\n1. Treatment name: Medically Induced Emesis (Vomiting).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Once at the clinic, the veterinarian may administer medication to safely induce vomiting, emptying the stomach of the toxic plant material2.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This intervention is critical for preventing the absorption of the dangerous lectins and wisterin glycosides. It is most effective when performed as soon as possible after the cat has ingested the plant2.\n3. Fluid Therapy\n1. Treatment name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team administers fluids to help flush the wisteria toxins out of the cat's body2.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because wisteria poisoning triggers severe, potentially bloody vomiting and profuse diarrhea, cats are at a high risk of life-threatening fluid loss [800, Conversation History]. Aggressive fluid therapy is essential to combat this severe dehydration and stabilize the animal [Conversation History].\n4. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: Symptomatic Medical Management and Monitoring.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will continuously monitor the cat and provide specific medications to manage the intense gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms [800, Conversation History].\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because wisteria ingestion can escalate to severe stomach cramps, central nervous system (CNS) damage, and physical collapse, the cat may require targeted pharmacological support to ease abdominal pain, stop nausea, and manage any neurological distress until the toxins clear its system [800, Conversation History]."
