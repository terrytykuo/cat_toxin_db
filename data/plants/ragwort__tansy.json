(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, it is not explicitly specified which distinct parts (such as the leaves, stems, or flowers) of Ragwort (also known as Tansy) are toxic to cats.\nHowever, the sources indicate that the plant in general is particularly toxic to felines because it contains harmful alkaloids and a volatile oil called thujone1. While ingesting the plant in large quantities can cause liver damage, the plant is fortunately quite unpleasant to eat, which typically deters most cats from consuming it1.",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, there are two primary toxic components identified in Ragwort (also known as Tansy) that are harmful to cats:\n1. Alkaloids\n1. Name of the compound: Alkaloids1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Ingesting the alkaloids present in the plant can cause liver damage1.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The plant must be ingested in large quantities to cause liver damage1. Fortunately, the plant is quite unpleasant to eat, which naturally deters most cats from consuming enough to be harmed1.\n2. Thujone (Volatile Oil)\n1. Name of the compound: Thujone (contained within a volatile oil)1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Similar to the plant's alkaloids, this volatile oil can cause liver damage if ingested1.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: It is toxic when ingested in large quantities, but the unpalatable nature of the plant typically prevents cats from eating dangerous amounts1.",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, there is limited detailed symptom data for Ragwort (also known as Tansy) other than its primary pathological effect. Here are the details regarding its effect on cats:\n1. Liver Damage\n1. Symptom name: Liver damage.\n2. Affected body system: Hepatic.\n3. Severity: Severe (implied by the source describing it as \"particularly toxic,\" though the exact severity scale word is not explicitly stated)1.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the provided sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Liver damage occurs due to the plant's alkaloid content and a volatile oil containing thujone1. The cat must ingest the plant in large quantities to suffer this damage1. Fortunately, Ragwort is quite unpleasant to eat, which usually acts as a natural deterrent and stops most cats from consuming it1.",
    "treatments": "\ud83d\udcda Loaded library with 1 notebooks\n\u26a0\ufe0f Browser state is 10.0 days old, may need re-authentication\n\ud83d\udcac Asking: What are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests Ragwort / Tansy?

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, there is no specific veterinary treatment protocol outlined exclusively for Ragwort (also known as Tansy). However, the sources note that Ragwort is particularly toxic and causes liver damage if ingested in large quantities due to its alkaloid content and a volatile oil containing thujone1.\nBecause the primary threat is liver damage, veterinarians would generally follow standard emergency protocols for toxic plant ingestion and hepatotoxicity (liver poisoning). Extrapolating from the sources' guidelines for liver-damaging plants and general poisoning, the recommended treatments, in order of priority, include:\n1. Immediate Veterinary Assessment\n1. Treatment name: Veterinary Consultation and Triage.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Contact your veterinarian or a pet poison helpline immediately for professional advice2. If you have evidence of what the cat ate, take a sample of the plant (or a sample of the cat's vomit, especially if it contains plant matter) to the vet to aid in diagnosis2.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: You should not attempt to make the cat sick at home, as this may not be helpful and can cause further harm2. Fortunately, Ragwort is quite unpleasant to eat, which usually acts as a natural deterrent and stops most cats from consuming the large quantities necessary to cause severe liver damage1.\n2. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Emesis Induction and Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: To prevent the plant's toxins from being fully absorbed into the bloodstream, a veterinarian may medically induce vomiting (emesis)3. This is typically followed by an antiemetic (anti-nausea medication) and doses of activated charcoal to bind to any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract3.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This decontamination step is most appropriate for a neurologically stable patient shortly after the plant has been ingested3. Due to enterohepatic recirculation (toxins cycling through the liver and intestines), multiple doses of activated charcoal may be recommended3.\n3. Liver Support and Protection\n1. Treatment name: Hepatoprotective Therapy.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Because Ragwort targets the liver1, the veterinary team will likely administer hepatoprotectants (liver-protecting medications) such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC)4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: These specific medications are necessary to support liver function and aid in tissue repair if hepatic necrosis (liver cell death) is occurring or suspected4.\n4. Systemic Supportive Care and Monitoring\n1. Treatment name: In-Hospital Monitoring and Symptomatic Support.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The cat will likely require hospitalization for close monitoring, which includes evaluating liver enzymes daily for a period of time (e.g., 72 hours)3. The vet may also administer gastroprotectants to soothe the stomach and intestines4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: If severe liver damage develops, secondary complications like hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and bleeding disorders (coagulopathy) can occur4. The veterinary team will monitor blood glucose and coagulation profiles, and if hypoglycemia is present, they will administer a continuous intravenous infusion of dextrose4."
