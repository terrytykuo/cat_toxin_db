List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Citrus plants (including the fruit, peels, seeds, leaves, and stems) contain citric acid and essential oils (such as limonene and linalool). While the flesh is generally mild, the oils found in the peels and plant parts are toxic to cats, potentially causing gastrointestinal distress, central nervous system (CNS) depression, and skin irritation. Concentrated citrus essential oils are particularly dangerous and can lead to liver failure.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Dermal Decontamination (Bathing)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Warm Water Bath with Liquid Dish Soap.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat has come into contact with citrus essential oils (often used in diffusers or sprays), the veterinarian (or owner under veterinary guidance) should bathe the cat using lukewarm water and a mild liquid dish soap (degreaser) to thoroughly remove the oily residue from the skin and fur.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is urgent because cats groom themselves; any oil left on the fur will be ingested, leading to systemic poisoning. Additionally, citrus oils can cause direct skin irritation or chemical burns. Do not use solvents or other cleaning products to remove the oil.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Oral Decontamination (Dilution) \u2014 Do NOT Induce Vomiting\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Mouth Rinsing and Dilution.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may rinse the cat's mouth with lukewarm water to remove localized toxins. They may also administer a small amount of milk or water to dilute the substance in the stomach and soothe irritated mucous membranes.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Inducing vomiting (emesis) is generally contraindicated for essential oil or citrus peel ingestion. The volatile oils can be aspirated into the lungs, causing severe pneumonia, and can cause further chemical burns to the esophagus if brought back up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,5,6\n3. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Supportive Fluid Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of IV fluids to rehydrate the cat, maintain blood pressure, and assist the body in eliminating toxins through the kidneys.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is critical if the cat is experiencing severe vomiting or diarrhea (common symptoms of citrus poisoning). Fluids also support the liver and kidneys, which are stressed by the processing of essential oil toxins.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:7,8\n4. Symptomatic Pharmacological Support\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Anti-emetics, Gastroprotectants, and Neuro-supportive Medication.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 GI Support: Medications to stop vomiting (anti-emetics) and coat the stomach lining (gastroprotectants) to treat the severe irritation caused by citric acid and oils.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Neurological Support: If the cat exhibits tremors or seizures (signs of severe essential oil toxicity), muscle relaxants or anti-seizure medications may be administered.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Ingestion of large amounts of citrus plant material or oils can cause CNS depression (weakness, collapse) or excitation (tremors). Liver protectants (hepatoprotectants) may also be used if blood tests indicate liver damage, as cats lack the enzymes to metabolize these compounds efficiently.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:9,10,2,11,8"
