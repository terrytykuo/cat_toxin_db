Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the primary toxic components in Hydrangea (Hydrangea spp.) are cyanogenic glycosides.\n1. Cyanogenic Glycosides\n1. Name of the compound: Cyanogenic Glycosides (specifically, the plant contains compounds that can metabolize into cyanide)12.\n2. Chemical formula: The sources do not provide the specific formula for the glycoside unique to Hydrangea, but the toxic byproduct released upon metabolism is Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) or the cyanide ion (CN\n\u2212\n)34.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cellular Hypoxia: When the plant parts (leaves, flowers, or buds) are chewed or digested, the cyanogenic glycosides are broken down by enzymes to release cyanide. Cyanide binds to ferric iron (Fe\n3+\n) in the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase within the mitochondria35.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Inhibition of Respiration: This binding blocks the electron transport chain, effectively preventing cells from using oxygen for energy production, leading to cellular hypoxia (oxygen starvation) despite the presence of oxygen in the blood34.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Concentration: The toxins are found in all parts of the plant, but the flowers and leaves contain the highest concentrations and pose the greatest risk6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: While the mechanism is potentially lethal (cyanide poisoning), severe cyanide toxicity in small animals like cats is uncommon and typically requires the ingestion of large amounts37. In most household cases, ingestion results in gastrointestinal distress (vomiting, diarrhea) rather than fatal systemic hypoxia26. However, because the potential for severe toxicity exists, veterinary attention is recommended for any ingestion7.",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Hydrangea (Hydrangea spp.) contains cyanogenic glycosides (compounds that can metabolize into cyanide) and possibly other irritants like saponins. While the plant is toxic, cases of severe poisoning in cats are relatively rare, with most ingestions resulting in gastrointestinal distress.\n1. Vomiting\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (Clinical signs typically appear quickly, potentially within hours).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: This is one of the most frequently reported symptoms. It occurs as the body attempts to expel the irritating plant material and toxins.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4,5\n2. Diarrhea\n1. Symptom Name: Diarrhea.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Often accompanies vomiting. The toxins irritate the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3,4,5\n3. Lethargy and Depression\n1. Symptom Name: Lethargy / Depression / Exhaustion.\n2. Affected Body System: Neurological / General Systemic.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Cats may appear unusually tired, weak, or unresponsive. General \"depression\" is a common clinical sign noted by veterinary sources.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:6,1,3,4,5\n4. Abdominal Pain\n1. Symptom Name: Abdominal Pain.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The cat may show signs of discomfort when the belly is touched or may hunch over due to gastrointestinal cramping.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:6\n5. Cyanide Toxicosis Signs (Rare but Possible)\n1. Symptom Name: Respiratory Distress (Dyspnea), Rapid Breathing (Tachypnea), or Seizures.\n2. Affected Body System: Respiratory / Cardiovascular / Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Very Rapid (10\u201360 minutes after ingestion).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Because Hydrangeas contain cyanogenic glycosides, large ingestions can theoretically lead to cyanide poisoning. Symptoms of this include almond-flavored breath, brick-red mucous membranes (gums), tremors, and collapse. However, severe cyanide toxicity from Hydrangea is uncommon in small animals compared to the mild GI symptoms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:7,8,4",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Hydrangea (Hydrangea spp.) contains cyanogenic glycosides. While severe cyanide poisoning is rare in cats compared to mild gastrointestinal upset, veterinary intervention focuses on decontamination and managing symptoms.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting) and Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent (typically within 1\u20132 hours), the veterinarian will administer medication to induce vomiting to expel the plant material. This is often followed by the administration of activated charcoal, which helps bind any remaining toxins in the stomach to prevent absorption into the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Early intervention is crucial for the best chance of a full recovery. You should not attempt to induce vomiting at home without veterinary guidance, as improper methods can cause further injury.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Fluid Therapy and Gastrointestinal Support.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian provides intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent or treat dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhea. They may also administer anti-emetics (to stop vomiting) and gastroprotectants to soothe the stomach lining.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because the most common symptoms of Hydrangea poisoning are lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea, supportive care is often the primary treatment needed to manage the animal's condition while the toxins clear their system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n3. Monitoring for Cyanide Toxicity (Rare)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Oxygen Support and Specific Antidotes (if severe).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Although rare with Hydrangea ingestion, the plant contains cyanogenic glycosides which can theoretically lead to cyanide poisoning. If severe signs such as rapid breathing (tachypnea) or bright red gums appear, the vet may administer oxygen and specific antidotes (such as sodium nitrite or sodium thiosulfate) to neutralize the cyanide.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Hydrangeas are generally considered to have a low likelihood of causing severe cyanide toxicity in small animals compared to other cyanogenic plants; most cases result only in gastrointestinal distress. However, veterinarians will monitor for these severe systemic signs as a precaution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,5,6"
