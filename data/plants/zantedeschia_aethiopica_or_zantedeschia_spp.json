What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, here is the information regarding the Calla Lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica or Zantedeschia spp.):\n1. Botanical Family: The Calla Lily belongs to the Araceae family (also known as the Arum family). The sources classify it as an \"imposter lily\" to distinguish it from \"true lilies\" (Lilium and Hemerocallis species) which belong to the Liliaceae family. It is grouped with other insoluble oxalate-containing plants in the Araceae family such as Dieffenbachia and Philodendron.\n2. Brief Description:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Classification: Calla Lilies are considered \"imposter lilies\" because they do not cause the acute kidney failure associated with true lilies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Habitat & Location: They are common houseplants and garden ornamentals, and are frequently found in floral bouquets and cut flower arrangements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Toxicity Characteristics: Unlike true lilies, Calla Lilies contain insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides) bundled in specialized cells, which cause physical irritation rather than systemic organ failure.\nSources:\n\u2022 Houseplants and Ornamentals Toxic to Animals - Toxicology - Merck Veterinary Manual1...\n\u2022 Do You Know Which Flowers and Plants are Toxic to Pets?

Unlike \"true lilies\" (Lilium spp.) which cause kidney failure, the Calla Lily's toxicity is primarily due to physical irritation caused by these crystals.\n1. Insoluble Calcium Oxalate Crystals\n1. Name of the compound: Insoluble Calcium Oxalate (specifically appearing as needle-like crystals called raphides).\n2. Chemical formula: CaC\n2\n\t\u200b\n\nO\n4\n\t\u200b\n\n.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Physical Trauma: The crystals are bundled within specialized plant cells known as idioblasts. When a cat bites or chews on the plant, these cells rupture, forcefully ejecting the needle-sharp raphides into the sensitive soft tissues of the mouth, tongue, throat, and esophagus.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Immediate Irritation: This mechanical action causes immediate, intense pain, burning sensations, and inflammation (edema). It can lead to swelling of the airways in severe cases, although the primary effect is localized tissue damage rather than systemic poisoning.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Distribution: These crystals are found in all parts of the plant, including the leaves, stems, and flowers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: The toxicity is generally classified as moderate. Because the pain is immediate and intense, cats usually stop eating the plant quickly, which limits the amount of toxin ingested. Systemic toxicity is rare, but severe swelling can occasionally compromise breathing.\nSources:1,2,3,4,5,6,7",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Calla Lily (Zantedeschia spp.) contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Unlike \"true lilies\" (Lilium spp.) which cause kidney failure, the toxicity of Calla Lilies is primarily due to physical irritation and inflammation caused by these crystals.\n1. Oral Irritation and Pain\n1. Symptom name: Intense burning sensation, pain, and irritation of the mouth, tongue, and lips.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (Oral Mucosa) / Dermal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate upon chewing or biting into the plant.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The plant contains microscopic, needle-like crystals (raphides) that embed into the soft tissues of the mouth immediately upon contact. This pain typically deters the cat from consuming large amounts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4\n2. Excessive Drooling\n1. Symptom name: Hypersalivation (Drooling).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate to rapid.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Drooling is a physiological response to the immediate mechanical irritation and burning sensation in the oral cavity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4,5,6,7\n3. Gastrointestinal Upset (Vomiting)\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting and Anorexia (Decreased appetite).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (shortly after ingestion).\n5. Additional clinical notes: While vomiting is a common sign, diarrhea is less frequent. Anorexia (refusal to eat) is often secondary to the pain in the mouth rather than systemic toxicity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4,5,8\n4. Difficulty Swallowing\n1. Symptom name: Dysphagia (Difficulty swallowing).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate to rapid.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The swelling and irritation of the tongue and pharynx make swallowing painful and difficult for the cat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,6\n5. Airway Obstruction / Difficulty Breathing\n1. Symptom name: Dyspnea (Difficulty breathing) due to laryngeal edema.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe (Rare).\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (as swelling develops).\n5. Additional clinical notes: In rare cases, the inflammatory response can cause swelling of the upper airway (tongue, throat, larynx), which can block air passages and compromise breathing. This requires immediate veterinary attention.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:9,4,6\nImportant Clinical Distinction: It is critical to note that Calla Lilies are considered \"imposter lilies.\" Unlike True Lilies (Lilium and Hemerocallis species), Calla Lilies do not cause acute kidney failure (renal failure) in cats. Their toxicity is limited to the gastrointestinal tract and upper airway irritation caused by oxalate crystals.\n\u2022 Sources:10,11,2,12",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Calla Lily (Zantedeschia spp.) contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Unlike \"true lilies\" (Lilium spp.), Calla Lilies do not cause acute kidney failure. The toxicity is primarily localized irritation to the mouth and gastrointestinal tract.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Oral Decontamination (Rinsing)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The immediate removal of any remaining plant material from the mouth, followed by thoroughly rinsing or wiping the oral cavity with lukewarm water or a wet cloth.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the most critical initial step to remove the needle-like crystals (raphides) that embed in the soft tissues. Rinsing helps stop the immediate burning sensation and prevents further injury to the mucous membranes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Administration of Demulcents (Calcium-Containing Products)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Feeding the cat small amounts of milk, yogurt, or other calcium-containing dairy products.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Insoluble oxalates bind to the calcium in dairy products, which helps precipitate the crystals and clear them from the oral cavity and esophagus. This also coats the irritated tissues, providing relief from pain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n3. Supportive Care (Fluids and Medications)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of antiemetics (to stop vomiting), analgesics (pain relief), and gastroprotectants. In cases of persistent vomiting or refusal to drink due to mouth pain, subcutaneous or intravenous fluid therapy is used to maintain hydration.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Most cases are self-limiting and resolve without aggressive intervention. However, if the cat is drooling excessively or unable to eat due to oral pain, supportive medications are necessary to maintain comfort and hydration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3,2\n4. Airway Monitoring and Management\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Close observation for signs of laryngeal edema (swelling of the throat). In rare, severe cases, veterinary intervention to secure an airway or provide oxygen support may be required.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: While rare, the inflammatory response to the crystals can cause swelling in the back of the throat that obstructs breathing. This is the most dangerous potential complication of insoluble oxalate ingestion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2"
