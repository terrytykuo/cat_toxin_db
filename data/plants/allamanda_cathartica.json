Severity: Mild to Moderate (Severity is explicitly noted as \"based on exposure dose\")1.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources, though gastrointestinal irritants typically manifest relatively quickly after ingestion.\n5. Additional clinical notes: This is a direct result of the compound plumericin acting as an irritant to the lining of the digestive tract1.\n2. Diarrhea\n1. Symptom name: Diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate (Dose-dependent)1.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified.\n5.

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the Merck Veterinary Manual, the recommended veterinary approach for Allamanda (Allamanda cathartica) ingestion focuses on managing the specific clinical signs presented by the animal, as the toxicity is dose-dependent.\nHere are the treatments in order of priority:\n1. Symptomatic Treatment\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: This is the primary course of action listed for Allamanda ingestion. It involves the administration of medications and supportive care specifically targeted to alleviate the clinical signs the cat is currently displaying, rather than using a specific antidote.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: The severity of the treatment depends entirely on the exposure dose. Veterinary intervention addresses the immediate abdominal discomfort and gastrointestinal distress caused by the plant's toxins12.\n2. Fluid Therapy (Rehydration)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of fluids (subcutaneous or intravenous) to restore hydration levels in the body.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is necessary to treat dehydration, a documented symptom of Allamanda toxicity resulting from the fluid loss associated with diarrhea12.\n3. Management of Electrolyte Imbalance\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Medical monitoring and replacement of essential minerals (electrolytes) to restore the body's natural balance.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Allamanda ingestion can cause electrolyte imbalance due to gastrointestinal upset; this condition requires veterinary assessment to prevent systemic complications12."
