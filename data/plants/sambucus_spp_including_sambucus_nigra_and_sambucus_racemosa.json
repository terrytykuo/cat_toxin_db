Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Elderberry plant (Sambucus spp.) contains cyanogenic glycosides, which are the primary toxic substances affecting cats.\n1. Cyanogenic Glycosides\n1. Name of the compound: Cyanogenic Glycosides (These compounds naturally occur in the plant as a defense mechanism).\n2. Chemical formula: The specific formula for the glycoside is not provided in the text, but upon ingestion, these compounds break down to release Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN), which is the active toxic agent.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Metabolic Conversion: When a cat chews or digests the plant material, enzymes hydrolyze the glycosides, releasing free cyanide into the bloodstream.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cellular Asphyxiation: The cyanide inhibits the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase within the mitochondria. This blocks the electron transport chain, effectively preventing cells from utilizing oxygen (cellular hypoxia), even though the blood is oxygenated. This leads to rapid respiratory distress and potential system failure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Gastrointestinal Irritation: Ingestion also causes immediate nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 High-Risk Parts: The highest concentrations of toxins are found in the stems, leaves, twigs, roots, and raw/unripe berries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cooking: While cooking destroys the cyanide-producing compounds making them safer for humans, sources warn that even cooked elderberries may still contain trace toxins harmful to cats due to their smaller size and metabolic sensitivity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sensitivity: Cats generally lack certain enzymes needed to properly metabolize plant compounds, making them more susceptible to toxicity than humans.\nSources:\n\u2022 Can Cats Eat Elderberries?

Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Elderberry (Sambucus spp.) contains cyanogenic glycosides, particularly in the leaves, stems, roots, and raw berries. Upon ingestion, these compounds release cyanide, leading to a range of symptoms from gastrointestinal upset to life-threatening systemic failure.\n1. Gastrointestinal Distress\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting, Diarrhea, Nausea, and Drooling (Hypersalivation).\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate (can lead to severe dehydration).\n4. Typical Onset Time: Quickly after ingestion.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: This is often the first sign of toxicity. The unripe/raw berries and vegetative parts (stems/leaves) are the most potent irritants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4,5,6\n2. Neurological Impairment\n1. Symptom Name: Lethargy, Weakness, Dizziness, Drowsiness, and Seizures.\n2. Affected Body System: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Rapid (Cyanide toxicity typically manifests within minutes to an hour).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Severe cases involving large ingestions can progress to seizures, tremors, and unresponsiveness (coma). This occurs because cyanide prevents cells from utilizing oxygen (cellular hypoxia).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3,4,7,6,8\n3. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom Name: Rapid Breathing (Tachypnea) or Difficulty Breathing (Dyspnea).\n2. Affected Body System: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Rapid.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Respiratory distress is a hallmark of cyanide poisoning. The cat may pant or gasp for air because, despite the blood being oxygenated, the cells cannot absorb the oxygen.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,4,9,10\n4. Systemic Collapse and Death\n1. Symptom Name: Collapse, Shock, and Death.\n2. Affected Body System: General / Cardiovascular.\n3. Severity: Fatal.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Rapid.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: While death is less common if only a few berries are eaten, ingestion of high-risk parts (roots, stems) or large amounts of raw berries can result in fatal cardiovascular collapse or respiratory failure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,4,9,8\n5. Cyanide-Specific Signs (Mucous Membranes)\n1. Symptom Name: Bright Red Gums (Brick Red Mucous Membranes) and Dilated Pupils.\n2. Affected Body System: Hematological / Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical Onset Time: 10\u201360 minutes (General timeline for cyanogenic glycosides).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Unlike other toxicities that cause pale gums, cyanide poisoning can cause gums to appear bright red because the oxygen in the blood is not being used by the tissues (venous blood remains oxygenated).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:11,9,10",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the sources, Elderberry (Sambucus spp.) contains cyanogenic glycosides which can release cyanide upon ingestion, particularly in the roots, stems, leaves, and raw berries. Veterinary treatment focuses on decontamination and, in severe cases, neutralizing the cyanide toxin.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting) and Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion is recent and the cat is neurologically stable (not having seizures or comatose), the veterinarian will administer medication to induce vomiting to remove the plant material from the stomach. This is typically followed by the administration of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and speed their transit out of the body.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Decontamination is most effective when performed promptly. Owners should not try to induce vomiting at home without specific veterinary instructions, as it can cause further harm.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Administration of Cyanide Antidotes\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Cyanide Antidote Therapy (Sodium Nitrite, Sodium Thiosulfate, or Hydroxycobalamin).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: In cases of severe poisoning where cyanide has been released into the bloodstream, specific antidotes are administered. Sodium nitrite helps convert hemoglobin to cyanomethemoglobin (which binds cyanide), followed by sodium thiosulfate, which converts cyanide into thiocyanate (a less toxic substance excreted in urine). Alternatively, hydroxycobalamin may be used to bind cyanide to form Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), which is then excreted.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This step is critical for life-threatening cases where the cat is showing signs of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) or severe distress. Clinical signs of cyanide toxicity can develop rapidly (within 15\u201360 minutes).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:3\n3. Oxygen Therapy and Respiratory Support\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Oxygen Supplementation or Mechanical Ventilation.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Because cyanide prevents the body's cells from using oxygen, the cat may experience severe respiratory distress. The vet will provide supplemental oxygen via a mask or cage. In critical cases where the cat cannot breathe adequately on its own, mechanical ventilation may be required.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This treatment addresses the \"tissue hypoxia\" caused by the toxin. Even if the blood is fully oxygenated, the cells cannot use it, so high-flow oxygen support is often necessary alongside antidotes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,5,3\n4. Metabolic Correction and Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) Fluids and Sodium Bicarbonate.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: IV fluids are administered to maintain blood pressure, support kidney function, and help excrete the detoxified cyanide compounds (thiocyanate). If the cat is suffering from metabolic acidosis (acidic blood pH due to the toxin), sodium bicarbonate is administered to correct the pH balance.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Fluid replacement is also essential to treat dehydration resulting from the vomiting and diarrhea commonly caused by elderberry ingestion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:6,3"
