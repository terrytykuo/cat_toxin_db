What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the only information available regarding Ylang Ylang is that its essential oil is highly toxic to cats1. The sources do not contain information about the plant's botanical family, physical appearance, or habitat.\n(Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it):\n1. Botanical Family Ylang Ylang (Cananga odorata) belongs to the custard apple family, Annonaceae.\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: Ylang Ylang is a fast-growing, medium-to-large evergreen tropical tree. It features gracefully drooping branches with long, smooth, glossy green leaves. The tree is heavily prized for its intensely fragrant, drooping flowers, which feature long, narrow, slightly twisted petals. These star-shaped flowers start out light green and turn a deep, vibrant yellow as they mature. After flowering, it produces clusters of small, dark, berry-like fruits.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and parts of Australia, it thrives in warm, humid, tropical climates with full sun and well-draining, acidic soils. Today, it is cultivated globally in tropical and subtropical regions (such as Madagascar and the Comoros Islands). It is most commonly found in commercial agricultural plantations where its flowers are harvested and distilled into essential oils for the perfume and aromatherapy industries, though it is also planted as a fragrant ornamental shade tree in tropical landscaping.",

(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the only form of Ylang Ylang explicitly listed as highly toxic to cats is its essential oil1.\nThe sources do not provide information on whether the physical parts of the Ylang Ylang plant itself (such as the leaves, flowers, stems, or roots) are toxic to cats.\n(Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it: While the Ylang Ylang plant itself is generally considered non-toxic to cats by the ASPCA, the essential oils extracted from its flowers are highly concentrated and extremely dangerous to felines. Cats lack the liver enzymes necessary to break down these volatile compounds, meaning that inhaling, absorbing, or ingesting the oil can lead to severe toxicity).",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nThe essential oil of Ylang Ylang is highly toxic to cats1. However, the provided sources do not identify the specific individual chemical compounds found within Ylang Ylang, their chemical formulas, or their precise cellular mechanisms of action.\nThe sources do explain the general mechanism for essential oil toxicity: cats lack specific liver enzymes (such as hepatic glucuronosyltransferase) needed to safely process and break down volatile plant compounds23. Because felines cannot efficiently metabolize these compounds, the toxins accumulate systemically and can cause serious organ damage, including liver failure, seizures, and death4. The sources also note that essential oils are exceptionally potent and hazardous when \"used neat\" (undiluted)5.\n(Please note that the following specific chemical information regarding Ylang Ylang is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it):\n1. Linalool\n1. Name of the compound: Linalool (a terpene alcohol).\n2. Chemical formula: C\n10\n\t\u200b\n\nH\n18\n\t\u200b\n\nO\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Because cats are deficient in the liver enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, they cannot properly bind (conjugate) and excrete terpene compounds like linalool. The compound rapidly absorbs through the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or lungs, accumulating in the bloodstream and tissues. It acts as a central nervous system depressant and causes acute hepatotoxicity (liver damage).\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Linalool is a major volatile component in Ylang Ylang essential oil. Because essential oils are heavily concentrated plant extracts, even a few drops inhaled, absorbed, or ingested can reach toxic thresholds in a cat.\n2. Benzyl Acetate\n1. Name of the compound: Benzyl acetate (an ester).\n2. Chemical formula: C\n9\n\t\u200b\n\nH\n10\n\t\u200b\n\nO\n2\n\t\u200b\n\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Similar to terpenes, cats struggle to metabolize esters efficiently due to their unique hepatic limitations. Benzyl acetate is readily absorbed and can cause severe gastrointestinal irritation, respiratory distress, and central nervous system depression, contributing to the overall toxic burden on the liver and kidneys.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: It is one of the primary components that give Ylang Ylang its signature sweet, floral scent. In the concentrated form of an essential oil, it is highly potent and dangerous to felines.\n3. Geraniol & Other Volatile Sesquiterpenes\n1. Name of the compound: Geraniol and various volatile sesquiterpenes (e.g., germacrene D, farnesene).\n2. Chemical formula: C\n10\n\t\u200b\n\nH\n18\n\t\u200b\n\nO (for Geraniol).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: These compounds further overwhelm the cat's deficient glucuronidation pathways. They induce oxidative stress and directly damage hepatocytes (liver cells), which can result in rapid liver failure, vomiting, ataxia (loss of coordination), and seizures.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Ylang Ylang essential oil is a complex mixture of these highly concentrated volatile organics. The cumulative effect of these compounds in 100% \"neat\" essential oil makes it exceptionally dangerous to cats, even via passive inhalation from a room diffuser.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the primary danger to cats regarding Ylang Ylang comes from its essential oil12. If a cat ingests, inhales, or comes into direct contact with Ylang Ylang essential oil, they can suffer from severe toxicity and exhibit the following symptoms34:\n1. Excessive Dribbling and Vomiting\n1. Symptom name: Excessive dribbling (drooling) and vomiting4.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate to severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Because cats are highly cleanly animals, they will often ingest toxic oils by licking them off their fur if they accidentally brush against them. They may also be poisoned by directly drinking the liquid out of reed diffusers3.\n2. Walking as if \"Drunk\"\n1. Symptom name: Walking as if they are drunk (ataxia)4.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Moderate to severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: A clear indicator of systemic neurological disruption caused by the essential oil4.\n3. Shaking, Tremoring, and Seizures\n1. Symptom name: Shaking, tremoring, seizures, and collapse34.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to fatal3.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: These represent extreme, life-threatening stages of essential oil poisoning3.\n4. Lethargy and Depression\n1. Symptom name: Lethargy, depression, or dullness4.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Systemic.\n3. Severity: Moderate to severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: If a cat exhibits these signs after potential exposure, a vet should be contacted immediately, even if no other severe symptoms have appeared yet45.\n5. Difficulty Breathing\n1. Symptom name: Difficulty breathing or breathing with the mouth open4.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: While toxic effects from passive inhalation are generally rare if the oils are heavily diluted, the risk of severe respiratory distress increases significantly if the cat is exposed to nebulized or ultrasonically diffused \"neat\" (undiluted) essential oils, or if the cat has pre-existing conditions like asthma23.\n6. Skin Irritation and Chemical Burns\n1. Symptom name: Sore, red skin, and chemical burns4.\n2. Affected body system: Dermal.\n3. Severity: Moderate to severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Caused by direct skin contact. Importantly, even if there is no visible damage to the skin, owners should not assume the cat is safe, as the toxic oil can still be absorbed transdermally34.\n7. Liver Failure\n1. Symptom name: Liver failure and serious organ damage3.\n2. Affected body system: Hepatic.\n3. Severity: Severe to fatal3.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified in the sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Because cats lack the ability to safely process the volatile compounds in essential oils, severe systemic accumulation can ultimately lead to liver failure and death [192, Conversation History].",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Ylang Ylang toxicity in cats is primarily caused by exposure to its highly concentrated essential oil12. Because cats lack the liver enzymes necessary to safely process the volatile compounds in essential oils, treatment must be aggressive and tailored to essential oil poisoning3.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments, listed in order of priority:\n1. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy\n1. Treatment name: Supportive IV Fluids.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian administers fluids intravenously to rapidly rehydrate the cat, help eliminate the toxins from the bloodstream, and provide essential support to the liver and kidneys4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is a critical first-line defense to prevent severe dehydration from vomiting and to protect the internal organs from the systemic buildup of the oil's toxins4.\n2. Liver Protection\n1. Treatment name: Hepatoprotective Medications.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The vet administers specific medications designed to shield the liver from sustaining acute damage.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is highly urgent because a cat's liver cannot naturally break down essential oils like Ylang Ylang; without intervention, the accumulation of these toxins can quickly lead to life-threatening liver failure3....\n3. Gastrointestinal Support and Symptom Management\n1. Treatment name: Anti-emetics and Stomach Protectants.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team provides anti-vomiting medications (anti-emetics) to stop fluid loss, alongside specialized medications that coat and protect the stomach lining4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Notably, the vet will not induce vomiting for essential oil ingestion. Essential oils can cause chemical burns, and forcing the cat to throw them back up can severely burn the esophagus and digestive tract4.\n4. Burn Management and Nutritional Support\n1. Treatment name: Pain Medication, Antibiotics, and Feeding Tube Insertion.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: If the cat has suffered chemical burns in its mouth or digestive tract, the vet will provide feline-safe pain medications and antibiotics. In severe cases where the cat cannot eat normally, a feeding tube will be temporarily inserted directly into the stomach4.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This allows the cat to receive necessary nutrition while bypassing the burned tissues in the mouth and throat until they are fully healed4.\n5. Dermal Decontamination (If applicable)\n1. Treatment name: Medicated Bathing / Fur Cleansing.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: If the essential oil is also on the cat's fur or skin, the veterinary team will bathe the cat using liquid dish soap and lukewarm water to strip the oils. If the cat is anxious or aggressive, the vet may use mild sedation to handle them safely6.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This step is vital even if the cat has already ingested some oil, because cats will continue to groom themselves and ingest more of the toxic oil if it is not completely removed from their coat26."
