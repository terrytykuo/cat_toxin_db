Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, particularly the Merck Veterinary Manual, the Century Plant (Agave americana) contains toxic compounds including calcium oxalate crystals (in the sap), saponins, and acrid volatile oils (in the leaves and seeds).\n1. Oral Mucosal Irritation\n1. Symptom name: Oral Mucosal Irritation (pain and irritation of the mouth).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (specifically the oral cavity and mucous membranes).\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate (The pain often limits the amount ingested).\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate (Calcium oxalate crystals typically cause immediate pain upon chewing).\n5. Additional clinical notes: The sap contains calcium oxalate crystals which cause physical irritation to the lining of the mouth and throat upon ingestion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1,2\n2. Edema (Swelling)\n1. Symptom name: Edema (Swelling).\n2. Affected body system: Dermal and Gastrointestinal (Oral tissues).\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid following contact or ingestion.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Swelling can occur in the mouth or on the skin where the plant sap has come into contact with the animal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1,2\n3. Dermal Irritation\n1. Symptom name: Dermal Irritation (Skin irritation/Dermatitis).\n2. Affected body system: Dermal (Skin).\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Upon contact with the sap.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The sap of the Century Plant is an irritant. Contact with the skin can cause redness, irritation, and swelling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1,2\nNote on Gastrointestinal Upset: While the sources specifically highlight irritation and edema for Agave americana, they also note the presence of saponins in the leaves and seeds1,2. In other plants listed in the same veterinary database (such as Sansevieria or Cyclamen), saponins are associated with vomiting and diarrhea3,4. However, the specific entry for Century Plant emphasizes mucosal irritation and edema.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Century Plant (Agave americana) contains calcium oxalate crystals in its sap, as well as saponins and acrid volatile oils in the leaves and seeds. Ingestion or contact primarily causes severe irritation and swelling (edema) rather than systemic organ failure.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Airway Assessment and Stabilization\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will immediately assess the cat for signs of laryngeal edema (swelling of the throat and upper airway). If the swelling is severe enough to obstruct breathing, they may need to secure an airway (intubation) or provide oxygen support.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: The calcium oxalate crystals found in the sap can cause significant edema (swelling) of the oral mucosa and throat. While rare, if the swelling restricts airflow, this becomes a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention before other treatments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Decontamination (Oral and Dermal)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Oral: Thoroughly rinsing the cat's mouth with cool water to flush out the needle-like calcium oxalate crystals and remaining plant material.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Dermal: If sap is on the fur or skin, the cat will be bathed with mild liquid dish soap and warm water to remove the irritant oils and sap.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Agave sap is specifically noted to cause dermal and oral mucosal irritation. Removing the source is critical to stop the pain and prevent the cat from ingesting more toxins while grooming.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n3. Symptomatic and Supportive Care (Pain Management & Fluids)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Medications: Administration of analgesics (pain relievers) to treat oral pain and anti-inflammatory medications to reduce swelling. Gastroprotectants or antiemetics may be given if vomiting occurs due to the saponins.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Demulcents: Feeding small amounts of calcium-containing products (like milk or yogurt) may be suggested to bind the oxalate crystals and soothe the mouth (if the cat is not lactose intolerant).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Fluid Therapy: Subcutaneous or intravenous fluids may be administered if the cat is dehydrated from inability to drink (due to mouth pain) or fluid loss.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Veterinary literature classifies the treatment for Agave americana specifically as \"Symptomatic.\" The goal is to manage the immediate pain and irritation until the reaction subsides. The prognosis is generally good to excellent once the irritation is managed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2"
