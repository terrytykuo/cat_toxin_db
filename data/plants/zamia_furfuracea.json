For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Cardboard Palm (Zamia furfuracea) is a cycad (not a true palm) and contains highly toxic compounds that can cause fatal organ failure in cats.\n1. Cycasin\n1. Name of the compound: Cycasin (a glycoside of methylazoxymethanol).\n2. Chemical formula: The provided sources do not explicitly list the chemical formula, but describe it as a glycoside that breaks down into methylazoxymethanol (MAM).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Hepatic Necrosis: Cycasin itself is not the active toxin; once ingested, it is hydrolyzed (broken down) by bacteria in the cat's intestinal tract into the toxic component methylazoxymethanol. This substance causes profound hepatic necrosis (liver tissue death).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Gastrointestinal Destruction: It triggers severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (bloody vomiting and diarrhea), leading to the destruction of the lining of the stomach and intestines.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Highest Concentration: While all parts of the plant (leaves, stems, roots) are toxic, the seeds (or nuts) contain the highest concentration of cycasin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Lethality: It is extremely potent; the ingestion of just 1\u20132 seeds can be fatal to a pet.\nSources:1,2,3,4,5\n2. Beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA)\n1. Name of the compound: Beta-methylamino-L-alanine (often abbreviated as BMAA).\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly listed in the provided sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Neurotoxicity: This compound is an amino acid that acts as a neurotoxin. It specifically targets the central nervous system, contributing to neurological symptoms such as weakness, ataxia (coordination loss), tremors, seizures, and paralysis.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 This toxin works in conjunction with cycasin to produce the plant's severe clinical profile. While liver failure (from cycasin) is often the cause of death, BMAA is responsible for the severe CNS (nervous system) effects observed during poisoning.\nSources:1,5",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Cardboard Palm (Zamia furfuracea) contains the same highly toxic compounds (cycasin and B-methylamino-L-alanine) as Sago Palms. Ingestion causes a rapid onset of gastrointestinal distress followed by severe multi-systemic failure.\n1. Severe Gastrointestinal Distress\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, Diarrhea (often bloody), and Hemorrhagic Gastritis.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Within 15 minutes to 4 hours of ingestion.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Vomiting is typically the first clinical sign observed. The diarrhea may appear black or \"tarry\" (melena) due to digested blood, indicating severe bleeding in the digestive tract.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Hepatic (Liver) Failure\n1. Symptom name: Icterus (Jaundice), Hepatic Necrosis, and Liver Failure.\n2. Affected body system: Hepatic.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Progression to liver failure typically occurs within 48\u201372 hours.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The toxin cycasin causes severe liver cell death. Clinical signs associated with this stage include yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) and fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4,3\n3. Neurological Abnormalities\n1. Symptom name: Ataxia (wobbly gait), Tremors, Seizures, Paralysis, and Coma.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Often follows initial GI signs; depression and paralysis may progress as liver failure worsens.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The plant contains the neurotoxin Beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), which contributes to these central nervous system effects. Depression and lethargy are common early signs that can progress to coma.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4,3\n4. Coagulopathy (Bleeding Disorders)\n1. Symptom name: Abnormal Bruising, Petechiae (pinpoint hemorrhages), and Nosebleeds.\n2. Affected body system: Hematological / Hepatic.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: 48\u201372 hours (secondary to liver failure).\n5. Additional clinical notes: As the liver fails, it cannot produce the necessary clotting factors, leading to spontaneous bleeding, blood clots, and visible bruising on the skin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,5,3\n5. Metabolic Instability\n1. Symptom name: Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) and Increased Thirst/Urination (Polydipsia/Polyuria).\n2. Affected body system: Hepatic / Renal / Metabolic.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: 48\u201372 hours (associated with liver failure).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Hypoglycemia develops secondary to hepatic necrosis and may contribute to weakness and seizures.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,5,6",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Cardboard Palm (Zamia furfuracea) is a cycad, containing the same dangerous toxins (cycasin and BMAA) as the Sago Palm. Veterinary treatment must be aggressive and immediate, as liver failure can develop within 48\u201372 hours.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Emesis and Activated Charcoal)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is neurologically stable (not having seizures or comatose), the veterinarian will induce vomiting (emesis) to remove plant material from the stomach. This is immediately followed by the administration of activated charcoal to bind the toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and prevent absorption.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because the toxin undergoes \"enterohepatic recirculation\" (it circulates between the liver and intestine), a single dose of charcoal is insufficient. Veterinarians typically recommend two additional doses of activated charcoal administered 6\u20138 hours apart after the initial dose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy and GI Support\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of IV fluids to maintain hydration, correct electrolyte imbalances, and support blood flow to vital organs. This is combined with anti-emetics (to stop vomiting) and gastroprotectants (medications to protect the stomach lining).\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This supportive care is critical because the plant causes severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (bloody vomiting and diarrhea), leading to rapid dehydration. Gastric protection is dosed based on the severity of the GI signs present.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,2,4\n3. Hepatoprotection (Liver Support)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of specific liver-protecting medications, most notably S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC).\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Since the primary cause of fatality is hepatic necrosis (liver death), these agents are \"necessary to support liver function and repair.\" Long-term monitoring of liver enzymes is often required even after the acute phase passes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4\n4. Neurological and Metabolic Management\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The use of methocarbamol or anticonvulsants to control tremors and seizures, and the administration of dextrose (sugar) via IV if blood sugar levels drop.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Liver failure can lead to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and coagulopathy (bleeding disorders). If the cat develops tremors or seizures (caused by the neurotoxin BMAA or liver failure), immediate seizure control is required.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,4"
