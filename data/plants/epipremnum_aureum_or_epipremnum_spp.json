What botanical family does it belong to? 2. Give a brief description of the plant (appearance, habitat, where commonly found). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, here is the information regarding Pothos, also known as Devil's Ivy (Epipremnum aureum):\n1. Botanical Family Pothos belongs to the Araceae family1.\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: Pothos is a green, leafy climbing vine or trailing plant1.... It is characterized by heart-shaped leaves that often have yellow streaks1. When grown outdoors in tropical environments, the leaves can grow quite large, but they remain much smaller when grown as a potted plant indoors1.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: While it naturally grows outdoors in the tropics, it is most frequently found in homes as a highly popular indoor houseplant1. Because it is a resilient and exceptionally easy-to-care-for plant, it is often recommended for beginner plant owners23.",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the primary toxic substance in Pothos (Devil\u2019s Ivy or Epipremnum aureum) is a physical and chemical irritant rather than a traditional chemical poison. Here are the details regarding its toxicity:\n1. Insoluble Calcium Oxalate Crystals (Raphides)\n1. Name of the compound: Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (often referred to as raphides)1....\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: The mechanism of action is primarily physical trauma. These microscopic, needle-like crystals are bundled together inside specialized plant cells known as idioblasts3. When a cat bites, chews, or crushes the leaves or stems of the Pothos plant, these cells forcefully eject the sharp crystals directly into the cat's oral mucosa and surrounding tissues23. This microscopic piercing causes immediate, intense burning pain and inflammation in the mouth, lips, and tongue1.... The body's inflammatory response leads to excessive drooling and swelling, which in severe cases can cause laryngeal edema (swelling of the throat) that may potentially obstruct the cat's airway25.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Pothos toxicity is generally classified as moderate1. The insoluble oxalate crystals are scattered throughout the entire plant45. However, because the crystals cause such immediate and intense pain the second the cat bites into the plant, the animal is usually deterred from eating large quantities24. As a result, Pothos poisonings are rarely fatal, and full recovery is typically expected25.",

Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Intense Oral Irritation and Pain\n1. Symptom name: Intense burning, irritation, and pain of the mouth, lips, and tongue12.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal (specifically the oral cavity)12.\n3. Severity: Moderate1.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This immediate and intense pain occurs because Pothos contains microscopic, needle-like insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (raphides)12. When a cat bites or chews the leaves or stems, these crystals are forcefully ejected directly into the oral mucosa2. Because the pain is instantaneous, cats are usually deterred from consuming a large amount of the plant, meaning fatalities are extremely rare23.\n2. Excessive Drooling (Hypersalivation)\n1. Symptom name: Excessive drooling or hypersalivation1....\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal2.\n3. Severity: Moderate1.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: This is a direct physical and inflammatory response to the microscopic trauma and irritation caused by the oxalate crystals piercing the cat's mouth12.\n3. Oral Swelling and Difficulty Swallowing\n1. Symptom name: Swelling of the mouth and tongue, accompanied by difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)1....\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal and Respiratory (if the airway becomes compromised)12.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe12.\n4. Typical onset time: Immediate to shortly after exposure2.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: The localized inflammatory response can cause the cat's mouth and tongue to become significantly swollen23. In severe cases, this swelling can progress to the throat and potentially obstruct the cat's airway, which requires immediate veterinary attention12.\n4. Vomiting\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting13.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal1.\n3. Severity: Moderate1.\n4. Typical onset time: Shortly after ingestion1.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: While the systemic toxicity of Pothos is relatively low and not typically life-threatening, the ingestion of the plant material and the resulting irritation cause extreme gastrointestinal discomfort and stomach upset2....",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Pothos (Devil\u2019s Ivy) contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that act as microscopic needles, causing immediate and intense pain, irritation, and swelling in the mouth and throat.\nWhile Pothos ingestion is rarely fatal and often resolves with minimal intervention, severe reactions can occur. Here are the recommended treatments, listed in order of priority (most urgent first):\n1. Airway Management and Oxygen Support\n1. Treatment name: Airway Management and Oxygen Supplementation.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: If the severe inflammatory response causes laryngeal edema (swelling of the throat and airway), the veterinarian will immediately intervene to secure the cat's airway and provide oxygen support1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is the most critical, life-threatening emergency associated with Pothos ingestion. If you notice your cat having any difficulty breathing or significant swelling of the mouth or throat, they must be taken to a veterinary emergency clinic immediately12.\n2. Oral Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Oral Decontamination (Removal and Rinsing).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Gently removing any remaining plant pieces from the cat's mouth and thoroughly rinsing or wiping out the oral cavity with cool water to flush away the sharp, embedded calcium oxalate crystals1....\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This is an immediate first-aid step to stop the ongoing microscopic trauma to the cat's tissues. You should never induce vomiting for Pothos ingestion unless specifically instructed by a vet, as bringing the sharp crystals back up can cause further severe pain and damage to the esophagus3.\n3. Calcium-Binding Liquid Therapy\n1. Treatment name: Oral Calcium Administration.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Offering the cat a small amount of a calcium-containing dairy product, such as milk or yogurt1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: The insoluble oxalate crystals will actively bind to the calcium in the dairy product. This helps comfortably clear the remaining crystals from the oral cavity and esophagus, significantly reducing the intense burning sensation1.\n4. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: Symptomatic Pain and Gastrointestinal Management.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may administer medications such as analgesics (pain relievers) to soothe the severe mouth pain, or demulcents to coat and protect the irritated mucous membranes4. Anti-nausea medications may also be given if the cat is experiencing secondary vomiting.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because the intense pain usually deters the cat from eating a large amount of the plant, full systemic poisoning is highly unlikely. Most cases of Pothos exposure have a good to excellent prognosis and the cat is expected to make a full recovery, often needing only at-home monitoring after the initial decontamination1. Always consult a veterinarian or pet poison hotline to determine exactly how much monitoring or medical support your specific cat needs23."
