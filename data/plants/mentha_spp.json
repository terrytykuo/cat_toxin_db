Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Common Garden Mint (Mentha spp.) is generally considered mildly toxic to cats, typically resulting in gastrointestinal upset if consumed in large quantities. However, essential oils derived from mint are highly toxic and can cause severe systemic reactions.\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingesting or being exposed to Common Garden Mint:\n1. Gastrointestinal Upset (Vomiting and Diarrhea)\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting and Diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified, but typically follows ingestion.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Garden mint contains essential oils that can irritate the stomach lining. Additionally, these oils are known to relax the esophageal valve, which increases the likelihood of vomiting, particularly in cats that are already feeling unwell12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,4,1,2\n2. Nausea and Excessive Drooling\n1. Symptom name: Nausea and Hypersalivation (Drooling).\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (often a response to taste or irritation).\n5. Additional clinical notes: The strong scent and taste of mint can be unappealing and irritating to cats, leading to drooling or foaming at the mouth24.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,4,2\n3. Weakness and Lethargy\n1. Symptom name: Lethargy and General Weakness.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / General.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Not explicitly specified.\n5. Additional clinical notes: While common with large ingestions, severe lethargy is more frequently associated with the consumption of concentrated mint oils or more toxic mint varieties like Pennyroyal1....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,4,1,2\n4. Skin Irritation\n1. Symptom name: Contact Dermatitis (Skin irritation).\n2. Affected body system: Dermal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (upon contact).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Direct contact with the plant can cause skin irritation or redness in hypersensitive cats12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n5. Respiratory Distress (Linked to Essential Oils)\n1. Symptom name: Difficulty breathing (Dyspnea), coughing, or sneezing.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (upon inhalation or aspiration).\n5. Additional clinical notes: This is a primary risk if the cat is exposed to mint essential oils or strong aromas rather than just the leaf. The cool odor can irritate the respiratory tract, and aspiration of oils can cause severe pneumonia2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,2\n6. Liver Failure (Rare/Specific Contexts)\n1. Symptom name: Liver damage or failure.\n2. Affected body system: Hepatic.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Delayed.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Severe liver complications are primarily associated with the ingestion of concentrated mint oils or the highly toxic Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium), rather than fresh garden mint leaves. However, large quantities of any mint containing essential oils can stress the liver2....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,4,1,2",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Common Garden Mint (Mentha spp.) generally causes only mild gastrointestinal upset, and most cases do not require extensive veterinary treatment. However, if a large quantity is ingested, or if the cat has pre-existing health issues, the following treatments may be recommended.\nHere are the veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastric Decontamination (Emesis or Gastric Lavage)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Removal of Stomach Contents (Induction of Vomiting or Stomach Pumping).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may induce vomiting (emesis) to expel the plant material from the stomach before it is digested. In more extreme cases, a gastric lavage (stomach pump) may be used to wash out the stomach.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This procedure is typically reserved for severe cases or recent massive ingestion. While one source mentions using hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting, another explicitly warns that hydrogen peroxide should never be used to induce vomiting in cats at home due to the risk of severe injury, so this should only be performed by a veterinary professional using appropriate medication.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Toxin Adsorption (Activated Charcoal)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian may administer a dose of activated charcoal. This substance binds to toxins remaining in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing them from being absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is often used in conjunction with decontamination to ensure any remaining toxins are neutralized.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:3\n3. Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Supportive Fluid Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of fluids directly into the vein (IV) to rehydrate the cat and stabilize their electrolyte levels.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is necessary if the cat has become dehydrated due to excessive vomiting or diarrhea, which are common symptoms of mint ingestion. It helps stabilize the animal while they recover.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3\n4. Symptomatic Medication (Anti-emetics and Gastroprotectants)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Anti-nausea Medication and Antacids.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The vet may give an injection to stop nausea (anti-emetic) and administer medications (antacids or gastric protectants) to coat and soothe the stomach lining.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Garden mint essential oils can relax the esophageal valve, making vomiting more likely; these medications help keep the cat comfortable and prevent further gastrointestinal irritation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:4,2,3\nImportant Note: Most ingestions of garden mint result in only mild symptoms and will not require aggressive treatment. Veterinary intervention is most urgent if the cat has eaten a very large amount, consumed concentrated essential oils (which are much more toxic), or if the cat has underlying liver or bowel disease.\n\u2022 Sources:4,2"
