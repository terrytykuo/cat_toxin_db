List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Homalomena \u2018Selby\u2019 contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. While veterinary intervention is not always necessary for mild cases, the following treatments are recommended if symptoms are persistent or severe.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Oral Decontamination (Irrigation)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Oral Rinsing / Irrigation.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian (or owner, under guidance) flushes the cat's mouth thoroughly with water. This helps to mechanically remove the needle-like oxalate crystals (raphides) and plant material that are embedding in the oral mucosa and causing pain.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the primary and most immediate step to relieve the intense burning and irritation caused by the crystals. It effectively reduces the source of the pain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:12\n2. Administration of Demulcents (Calcium Binding)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Dairy Products (Milk or Yogurt).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The cat is fed or administered milk, yogurt, or another calcium-containing liquid. The calcium in these products binds to the insoluble oxalate crystals, helping to neutralize them and facilitate their clearance from the mouth and esophagus.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This can soothe the irritated tissues and is often recommended alongside rinsing to provide relief from the \"pins and needles\" sensation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:2\n3. Symptomatic and Supportive Care\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Fluid Therapy, Anti-emetics, and Analgesics.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Fluids: Intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous fluids are administered to correct dehydration if the cat has been vomiting or refusing to drink due to mouth pain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Medications: Anti-emetics (to stop vomiting) and analgesics (pain relievers) may be given to manage gastrointestinal distress and oral discomfort.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is necessary if the cat is experiencing persistent vomiting, diarrhea, or is lethargic and unable to eat. Most animals recover within 24\u201348 hours with this supportive care.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1...\n4. Airway Management (Rare)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Oxygen Support and Airway Security.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: In rare, severe cases where laryngeal edema (swelling of the throat) occurs, the veterinarian may need to provide supplemental oxygen or secure the airway (intubation) to ensure the cat can breathe.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: While swelling is a common symptom of insoluble oxalate ingestion, severe respiratory distress is less common but requires immediate emergency intervention if it occurs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:2"
