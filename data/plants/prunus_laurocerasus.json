Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) contains the following toxic compounds harmful to cats:\n1. Cyanogenic Glycosides (producing Cyanide)\n1. Name of the compound: The plant contains cyanogenic glycosides (specifically noted as amygdalin in related Prunus and Rosaceae species). When the plant material is chewed or crushed, these compounds are converted into the active toxin cyanide (also referred to as hydrogen cyanide)1....\n2. Chemical formula: The sources explicitly identify the released toxic agent as hydrogen cyanide (HCN)1.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cellular Hypoxia: Upon ingestion, the glycosides undergo enzymatic hydrolysis (breakdown) in the digestive tract to release cyanide. Cyanide is a potent cellular toxin that inhibits the enzyme mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Oxygen Blockage: By binding with ferric iron (Fe\n3+\n) in the cells, cyanide prevents the cells from utilizing oxygen for energy production, leading to tissue hypoxia (oxygen starvation at the cellular level) and rapid systemic failure2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Systemic Failure: This cellular suffocation leads to respiratory distress, bright red mucous membranes (due to trapped oxygen in the blood that cells cannot use), shock, and respiratory paralysis45.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 High Concentration Parts: The leaves and seeds (pits) contain the highest concentration of these harmful substances56.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Rapid Onset: Toxicity is rapid; clinical signs such as difficulty breathing, tremors, and sudden collapse can appear within 10 to 60 minutes of ingestion3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Fatality: Because the onset is so fast and the toxin halts basic cellular respiration, death can occur quickly, often before veterinary treatment can begin3.\nSources:\n\u2022 Houseplants and Ornamentals Toxic to Animals - Toxicology - Merck Veterinary Manual23\n\u2022 The top 12 most poisonous plants for pets - Avonvale Veterinary Centre56\n\u2022 Clinical Perspectives on Feline Phytotoxicology14",

Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) toxicity is caused by cyanogenic glycosides (specifically amygdalin), which convert to cyanide upon ingestion. This leads to cellular hypoxia (inability of cells to use oxygen) and rapid systemic failure.\n1. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom name: Tachypnea (rapid breathing), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), or respiratory paralysis.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (often within 10 to 60 minutes).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Because the toxin prevents cells from using oxygen, the cat may gasp for air or pant heavily. Respiratory paralysis is a specific risk associated with Cherry Laurel ingestion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Mucous Membrane Discoloration\n1. Symptom name: \"Brick red\" gums and cherry-red blood.\n2. Affected body system: Hematological / Circulatory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (10\u201360 minutes).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Unlike other conditions that cause pale or blue gums, cyanide poisoning causes the blood to remain fully oxygenated (because tissues cannot extract the oxygen), leading to a characteristic bright red color in the mucous membranes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n3. Neurological Abnormalities\n1. Symptom name: Tremors, seizures, dilated pupils, incoordination (ataxia), and sudden collapse.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (10\u201360 minutes).\n5. Additional clinical notes: As the brain is deprived of usable oxygen, the cat may exhibit severe neurological signs progressing to coma and death.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n4. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom name: Hypersalivation (drooling), vomiting, and diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (often the first sign).\n5. Additional clinical notes: You may detect a bitter \"almond-like\" odor on the cat's breath. The plant material also causes inflammation of the mucosa (lining of the mouth and stomach).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n5. Cardiac Failure\n1. Symptom name: Arrhythmias (irregular heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and cardiac arrest.\n2. Affected body system: Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid.\n5. Additional clinical notes: The toxin causes a rapid decline in cardiac function, often leading to sudden death before veterinary treatment can be administered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) contains cyanogenic glycosides (specifically in the leaves and seeds/pits), which release cyanide upon ingestion. This results in rapid tissue hypoxia (oxygen starvation). Clinical signs can appear within 10 to 60 minutes, and death can occur quickly, making immediate veterinary intervention critical.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Administration of Specific Antidotes\n\u2022 Treatment name: Cyanide Antidote Therapy (Hydroxycobalamin or Sodium Nitrite & Sodium Thiosulfate).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Veterinarians may administer hydroxycobalamin, which binds with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) that is safely excreted in urine. Alternatively, a combination of sodium nitrite (to form cyanomethemoglobin, which binds cyanide) followed by sodium thiosulfate (to convert cyanide into thiocyanate for excretion) may be used.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the most critical step for a symptomatic cat because cyanide causes rapid respiratory and cardiac failure. In less severe cases, sodium thiosulfate alone may be used.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Oxygen Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment name: Oxygen Supplementation.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Providing 100% oxygen to the cat via a mask, flow-by, or oxygen cage.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because cyanide prevents cells from using oxygen (cellular hypoxia), the cat will experience respiratory distress and \"air hunger\" even if their blood appears well-oxygenated (often indicated by bright red gums). Supportive oxygen helps maximize availability while antidotes work.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3\n3. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment name: Induction of Emesis and Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is asymptomatic (showing no signs yet) and the ingestion was recent (within 1\u20132 hours), the vet may induce vomiting to remove the plant material. This is followed by a dose of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind toxins remaining in the gut.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Decontamination should only be performed if the cat is neurologically stable. If the cat is already seizing or having trouble breathing, inducing vomiting is dangerous due to the risk of aspiration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n4. Correction of Metabolic Acidosis\n\u2022 Treatment name: Sodium Bicarbonate Administration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will monitor venous blood gas levels. If the cat is suffering from severe metabolic acidosis (a dangerous buildup of acid in the body common with cyanide toxicity), sodium bicarbonate is administered intravenously to correct the pH balance.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Severe metabolic acidosis is a common complication that must be managed to prevent systemic organ failure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1"
