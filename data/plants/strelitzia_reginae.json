List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia reginae) is considered mildly to moderately toxic to cats. The seeds contain toxic tannins, and the leaves contain hydrocyanic acid. Treatment is largely supportive and symptomatic, as the plant is typically not fatal but can cause significant discomfort.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Inducing Vomiting)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent, the veterinarian may administer medication to induce vomiting (emesis) to expel the plant material from the stomach before toxins are fully absorbed.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is a general protocol for plant poisoning to prevent further absorption of toxins. Sources emphasize that pet owners should not attempt to induce vomiting at home (e.g., using hydrogen peroxide) as it can cause injury; this must be done by a veterinary professional.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of intravenous (IV) fluids to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is necessary to counteract dehydration caused by the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Bird of Paradise ingestion, specifically vomiting and diarrhea. Fluid therapy also helps flush toxins from the body and supports kidney function.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3,4\n3. Symptomatic Management and Monitoring\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The use of medications to control nausea and close observation of vital signs, particularly respiratory effort.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because the leaves contain hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid), veterinarians will monitor for and treat labored breathing. Additionally, since the plant is known to cause specific eye discharge and gastrointestinal irritation (from tannins), care may include eye treatments or gastroprotectants to soothe the stomach.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3,4"
