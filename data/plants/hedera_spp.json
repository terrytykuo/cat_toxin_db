Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, English Ivy (Hedera helix and related species) contains specific chemical compounds that are toxic to cats, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal system.\n1. Triterpenoid Saponins (Hederagenin and Hederin)\n1. Name of the compound: Triterpenoid Saponins (specifically identified as Hederagenin and Hederin in the sources).\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Gastrointestinal Irritation: These saponins act as irritants to the gastrointestinal tract. Upon ingestion, they cause abdominal pain, excessive drooling (hypersalivation), vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Absorption: One source notes that the toxin is poorly absorbed upon ingestion, which typically limits the toxic effects to gastrointestinal issues rather than systemic organ failure.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Foliage vs. Berries: While the plant produces black berries, the leaves (foliage) are explicitly cited as being more toxic than the berries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Severity: Toxicity is generally considered moderate.\nSources:1,2,3,4,5\n2. Polyacetylene Compounds\n1. Name of the compound: Polyacetylene compounds.\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly provided in the sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 These compounds work in conjunction with hederagenin to cause the clinical signs of toxicity, including vomiting, abdominal pain, and hypersalivation.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Like the saponins, these are found within the plant material, with the foliage noted as the more toxic component compared to the berries.\nSource:3",

Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, English Ivy (Hedera helix and related species) contains triterpenoid saponins (specifically hederagenin) and polyacetylene compounds. Toxicity is generally considered moderate, and the foliage is more toxic than the berries. Because the toxins are poorly absorbed, signs are usually limited to the gastrointestinal tract.\n1. Vomiting\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate (Limited toxic effects are usually observed because the toxin is poorly absorbed, though large ingestions increase severity).\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (Symptoms typically appear shortly after ingestion, though specific hourly timelines are not explicitly listed for Ivy, recovery is often within 24-48 hours).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: This is a primary sign of saponin ingestion. The foliage (leaves) contains higher concentrations of the toxin than the berries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4,5\n2. Diarrhea\n1. Symptom Name: Diarrhea.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Resulting from the irritation of the gastrointestinal tract by the saponins.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4\n3. Abdominal Pain\n1. Symptom Name: Abdominal Pain (Stomach Discomfort).\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: The cat may show signs of discomfort or sensitivity when the abdomen is touched due to the irritating nature of the plant compounds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4,5\n4. Excessive Drooling (Hypersalivation)\n1. Symptom Name: Drooling / Hypersalivation.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal (Oral).\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Immediate to Acute (Upon chewing).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Caused by the immediate irritation of the mouth and mucous membranes by the plant's sap and saponins.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3,5",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, English Ivy (Hedera helix and related species) contains triterpenoid saponins (specifically hederagenin) which are poorly absorbed but act as potent local irritants. Veterinary treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on managing the gastrointestinal distress caused by the plant's foliage and berries.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination (Oral Rinsing and Removal)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Oral Decontamination / Irrigation.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The immediate step is to prevent further ingestion and remove any remaining plant material from the cat's mouth. The mouth is then thoroughly rinsed with water to wash away the irritating sap and crystals that cause drooling and pain.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because the toxins are poorly absorbed, systemic decontamination (like inducing vomiting) is not always necessary unless a large amount was ingested. Rinsing helps soothe the immediate burning sensation and oral irritation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Fluid Therapy and Electrolyte Correction\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) or Subcutaneous Fluid Therapy.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat has experienced significant vomiting or diarrhea, the veterinarian will administer fluids to correct dehydration and restore electrolyte balance.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the primary treatment for cases showing clinical signs. Since the toxin primarily causes gastrointestinal upset (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), maintaining hydration is critical for recovery.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:2\n3. Symptomatic Medication (Anti-emetics)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Administration of Anti-emetics.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Veterinarians may administer medications to stop persistent vomiting (anti-emetics) and soothe the gastrointestinal tract (gastroprotectants).\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: English Ivy toxicity is generally considered moderate and often self-limiting. Medication is typically reserved for cats causing significant distress or those at risk of severe dehydration from prolonged vomiting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2"
