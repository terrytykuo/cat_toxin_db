(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the seeds of the Rosary Pea (Abrus precatorius) are the toxic part of the plant1.\nHowever, there is an important distinction regarding how they are ingested: the highly dangerous toxin (abrin) is only released if the hard outer coat of the seed is chewed or broken1. If a cat swallows the seed whole and it remains intact, it is generally considered non-toxic1.",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Abrin\n1. Name of the compound: Abrin (a plant lectin or toxalbumin related to ricin)1.\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Abrin is a highly dangerous toxin that works by inhibiting cellular protein synthesis1. When absorbed, it leads to severe gastrointestinal signs, which can cause significant dehydration and dangerous electrolyte imbalances1.\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: The toxin is only released if the hard seed coat of the Rosary Pea is chewed, crushed, or otherwise broken1. Because the seed coat is so hard, if a cat swallows the seed whole and it remains intact, it is generally considered non-toxic1. If the seed is chewed and the toxin is released, severe cases require veterinary treatment for electrolyte replacement1.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources and our conversation history, a cat will only show symptoms of toxicity if the hard outer coat of the Rosary Pea seed is chewed or broken, which releases a highly dangerous toxin called abrin1. If the seed is swallowed whole and remains intact, it is generally considered non-toxic1.\nIf the seed is chewed, the primary symptoms are related to severe stomach upset. Here are the details:\n1. Gastrointestinal Distress (GI Signs)\n1. Symptom name: Gastrointestinal signs (which typically lead to significant dehydration and electrolyte imbalances)1.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal1.\n3. Severity: Severe1.\n4. Typical onset time: Not specified in the provided sources.\n5. Any additional clinical notes: Abrin is a plant lectin (toxalbumin) that works by inhibiting cellular protein synthesis1. When absorbed, the resulting gastrointestinal distress can cause severe dehydration and dangerous electrolyte imbalances1. In these severe cases, the cat will require veterinary treatment for fluid and electrolyte replacement1.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, if a cat ingests Rosary Pea (Abrus precatorius), the toxicity and required treatments depend heavily on whether the hard seed coat was broken. If the seeds are swallowed whole and remain intact, they are typically non-toxic1. However, if the seed is chewed, the highly dangerous toxin abrin is released, causing gastrointestinal distress1.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments based on the provided text, listed in order of priority:\n1. Veterinary Assessment and Triage\n1. Treatment name: Assessment of Dehydration and Electrolyte Status.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will examine the cat to evaluate the severity of the gastrointestinal signs and determine the extent of any dehydration and electrolyte imbalances1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This initial assessment is critical because if the cat swallowed the seeds whole without chewing them, it is usually non-toxic and may not require further medical intervention1.\n2. Systemic Supportive Care\n1. Treatment name: Electrolyte Replacement Treatment.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team will administer fluids and electrolytes to restore the cat's normal physiological balance and counteract the fluid loss caused by the gastrointestinal symptoms1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: This therapy is specifically indicated and necessary for severe cases where the seed coat was broken, releasing the toxin (abrin) and causing significant illness1."
