(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the following parts of the Apricot plant (Prunus spp.) are considered toxic or hazardous to cats:\n\u2022 Seeds/Pits (Kernels): This is the most dangerous part. The hard stone (pit) in the center of the fruit contains the seed, which is rich in amygdalin (a cyanogenic glycoside). When chewed, crushed, or digested, this compound breaks down into cyanide, which is highly toxic to cats. Additionally, the pit poses a physical danger as a choking hazard or cause of intestinal obstruction.\n\u2022 Leaves and Stems: Plants in the Prunus genus (which includes apricots, cherries, and peaches) typically contain cyanogenic glycosides in their stems and leaves as well as their seeds. Ingesting these parts can lead to cyanide poisoning.\nSafe Parts:\n\u2022 Fruit Flesh: The flesh of the apricot itself is generally considered safe for cats to eat in small amounts, provided the toxic pit and seeds have been completely removed.\nSummary of Toxic Parts:\n\u2022 Seeds (Pits/Stones)\n\u2022 Leaves\n\u2022 Stems",

For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Apricot (Prunus armeniaca) contains a specific toxic compound found primarily in the pit (seed), stems, and leaves.\n1. Amygdalin (Cyanogenic Glycoside)\n1. Name of the compound: Amygdalin (a cyanogenic glycoside). When metabolized, it releases Hydrogen Cyanide (Cyanide)12.\n2. Chemical formula: The sources explicitly identify the release of HCN (Hydrogen Cyanide)2.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Activation: The compound is relatively harmless in its intact form. However, when the apricot pit (seed) is chewed, crushed, or digested, amygdalin interacts with digestive enzymes and undergoes hydrolysis, releasing hydrogen cyanide into the bloodstream12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cellular Asphyxiation: Once released, cyanide acts as a potent cellular toxin. It binds tightly to ferric (Fe3+) iron within cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme in the mitochondria34.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Respiratory Arrest: This binding disrupts the electron transport chain and halts cellular respiration. Consequently, the cat's cells are unable to utilize oxygen to generate energy (ATP), leading to tissue hypoxia (oxygen starvation) and rapid systemic failure, even though the blood is fully oxygenated35.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Location: The toxin is concentrated in the seeds/pits, stems, and leaves46. The flesh of the fruit contains only trace or negligible amounts and is generally considered safe17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Bioavailability: The hard outer pit must be broken (chewed or crushed) to release the toxin. Swallowing a seed whole often prevents the release of cyanide4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: While the seeds contain \"trace amounts\" of cyanide compounds that may not be harmful in small normal quantities, ingesting large quantities can be dangerous7. However, cyanide is described as a \"potent cellular toxin,\" and clinical signs can develop rapidly (within 10\u201360 minutes) leading to shock and death if untreated56.",

For each symptom provide: 1. Symptom name. 2. Affected body system (gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, cardiac, dermal, respiratory, hepatic, hematological). 3. Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the flesh of the Apricot (Prunus armeniaca) is generally considered safe, but the seeds/pits, leaves, and stems contain amygdalin (a cyanogenic glycoside). When chewed or crushed, these parts release cyanide, which causes rapid and severe toxicity in cats.\nHere are the symptoms of Apricot (Cyanide) toxicity:\n1. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom name: Respiratory Distress (Difficulty Breathing, Panting, Tachypnea, Hyperventilation).\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid; typically within 10\u201360 minutes to a few hours after ingestion.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Signs include panting, gasping for breath, or rapid breathing. This occurs because the cyanide toxin prevents cells from utilizing oxygen (cellular hypoxia), even though the blood is fully oxygenated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4,5,6\n2. Brick Red Mucous Membranes\n1. Symptom name: Bright Red Gums/Mucous Membranes.\n2. Affected body system: Hematological / Cardiovascular.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (minutes to hours).\n5. Additional clinical notes: The gums and tongue may appear unusually bright red or pink (often described as \"cherry red\"). This coloration results from an abundance of oxygen in the blood that the tissues are unable to absorb due to the toxin blocking cellular respiration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3,4,5,6\n3. Dilated Pupils\n1. Symptom name: Dilated Pupils (Mydriasis).\n2. Affected body system: Neurological / Ocular.\n3. Severity: Moderate to Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (minutes to hours).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Enlarged pupils are a classic sign of cyanide poisoning often appearing alongside respiratory and cardiovascular distress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:7,1,2,3,4,6,8\n4. Shock and Sudden Collapse\n1. Symptom name: Shock / Collapse / Weakness.\n2. Affected body system: Cardiovascular / Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (10\u201360 minutes).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Hypotension (low blood pressure) and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) can lead to sudden weakness, staggering, and collapse. Death can occur quickly if untreated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:7,1,3,4,5,6\n5. Seizures and Tremors\n1. Symptom name: Seizures (Convulsions) and Muscle Tremors.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid.\n5. Additional clinical notes: As the brain is deprived of usable oxygen, the cat may experience tremors and violent convulsions, eventually lapsing into a coma.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3,5,6,8\n6. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, Salivation (Excessive Drooling), and Diarrhea.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate (often the initial signs).\n4. Typical onset time: Minutes to hours.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Salivation is frequently noted as an early sign. While GI obstruction is a risk if a whole pit is swallowed, chemical toxicity causes these symptoms due to systemic poisoning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,5,6",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the flesh of the Apricot (Prunus armeniaca) is generally safe, but the seeds/pits, stems, and leaves contain cyanogenic glycosides (amygdalin). If chewed or crushed, these parts release cyanide, a fast-acting toxin that causes cellular hypoxia (oxygen starvation).\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments for Apricot seed/pit ingestion, listed in order of priority for a toxic exposure:\n1. Specific Antidote Administration\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of specific antidotes to bind and neutralize the cyanide toxin. This typically involves using sodium nitrite (to form cyanomethemoglobin) followed by sodium thiosulfate (to form thiocyanate, which is excreted in urine). Alternatively, hydroxycobalamin (Vitamin B12a) may be used to bind with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12).\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is critical for life-threatening cases where the cat has ingested a large amount of crushed seeds and is showing severe signs like seizures or respiratory distress. Cyanide acts rapidly (within 10\u201360 minutes), and death can occur before treatment begins, making the antidote vital if the animal survives transport.\n\u2022 Sources:1,2\n2. Oxygen Therapy\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Providing supplemental oxygen to the cat, often via a mask, cage, or flow-by method.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Since cyanide prevents cells from utilizing oxygen (tissue hypoxia), oxygen therapy is a primary supportive measure to help maintain cellular function and aid recovery while the toxin is cleared or neutralized.\n\u2022 Sources:1,3\n3. Decontamination (Emesis & Activated Charcoal)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Inducing vomiting (emesis) to remove the plant material from the stomach, followed by the administration of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the standard protocol for asymptomatic patients who have recently ingested the seeds or plant parts. Emesis is generally not induced if the cat is already showing severe neurological signs (like seizures) due to the risk of aspiration.\n\u2022 Sources:2\n4. Correction of Metabolic Acidosis\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of sodium bicarbonate to balance the pH level of the cat's blood.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Severe cyanide toxicity often causes severe metabolic acidosis (too much acid in the body fluids). Veterinarians monitor this via venous blood gas analysis and treat it to stabilize the cat's systemic condition.\n\u2022 Sources:2\n5. Surgical Intervention (For Pit Obstruction)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Surgical removal or endoscopic retrieval of the apricot pit from the throat, stomach, or intestines.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: While the chemical toxin is the immediate threat, the hard pit (stone) presents a significant physical risk of choking or causing an intestinal blockage (obstruction). Surgery is required if the pit becomes lodged in the digestive tract.\n\u2022 Sources:4,5,6"
