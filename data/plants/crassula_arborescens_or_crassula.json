Ingestion typically results in gastrointestinal upset and neurological signs.\n1. Vomiting\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild to Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute (Clinical signs typically appear shortly after ingestion).\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: This is the most consistent symptom reported. The plant is considered an irritant to the stomach lining.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3,4\n2. Incoordination (Ataxia)\n1. Symptom Name: Loss of Balance / Incoordination / Ataxia.\n2. Affected Body System: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Acute.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Cats may appear \"drunk,\" wobbly, or unable to walk in a straight line.

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the toxic principle of the Jade Plant (Crassula species) remains unknown, but ingestion typically results in gastrointestinal irritation, neurological depression, and coordination issues. Veterinary treatment is primarily supportive and symptomatic.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Removal of Plant Material / Induction of Emesis.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The immediate step is to remove any remaining plant material from the cat's mouth. If the ingestion is recent (typically within a few hours), a veterinarian may administer medication to induce vomiting (emesis) to expel the plant material from the stomach before further absorption occurs.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Do not try to induce vomiting at home without specific veterinary instruction, as this can cause complications. This step is most effective if performed shortly after the cat has eaten the plant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Clinical Monitoring (Neurological and Cardiac)\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Observation for CNS Depression and Bradycardia.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team will monitor the cat's vital signs, specifically looking for a slowed heart rate (bradycardia) and neurological signs such as lethargy (depression) or loss of coordination (ataxia).\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Jade Plant toxicity is distinct from many other plant poisonings because it causes incoordination and depression in addition to standard stomach upset. While rare, a slowed heart rate is a specific risk factor associated with this plant that requires professional monitoring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3\n3. Supportive Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) or Subcutaneous Fluid Administration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Fluids are administered to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance, which helps the body flush out toxins and recover from fluid loss due to vomiting.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Since vomiting is a primary symptom of Jade Plant ingestion, preventing dehydration is a key component of the recovery process.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3,2"
