Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\n1. Cardiac Glycosides (Specifically Oleandrin)\n1. Name of the compound: Cardiac glycosides, specifically a type of cardenolide known as oleandrin1....\n2. Chemical formula: Not provided in the given sources.\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats: Cardiac glycosides directly interfere with the heart\u2019s electrical system and muscle contractions12. They do this by inhibiting the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase pump within the cells34. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium, which subsequently causes a rapid increase in intracellular calcium34. This severe disruption of normal electrical conduction forces the cat's cardiac muscle contractions to become much more forceful, yet slower, resulting in life-threatening heart arrhythmias, low blood pressure, and potential cardiovascular collapse3....\n4. Any notes on concentration or potency: Oleander is considered to be among the absolute most toxic plants that contain cardiac glycosides and possesses an extremely narrow margin of safety46. All parts of the plant are highly poisonous, and the toxins are so potent and concentrated that even drinking a small amount of the water from a vase or plant base holding oleander can cause severe toxicity1.... There is no safe level of ingestion for a cat3.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Oleander (Nerium oleander) contains highly toxic cardiac glycosides that severely disrupt the heart's electrical system. Veterinary treatment must be aggressive and immediate.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments if a cat ingests Oleander, listed in order of clinical priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n1. Treatment name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting) and Repeated Activated Charcoal.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: If the cat is asymptomatic and the ingestion was recent, the veterinarian will medically induce vomiting to remove the plant material from the stomach1. This is followed by administering an antiemetic and a dose of activated charcoal with a cathartic (to bind the toxins and speed their exit through the digestive tract)1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because cardiac glycosides undergo enterohepatic recirculation (meaning the toxins are repeatedly reabsorbed by the liver and intestines), the activated charcoal treatment must be repeated every 6 to 8 hours for a total of 3 doses (with the subsequent doses given without a cathartic)1.\n2. Antidote Administration\n1. Treatment name: Digoxin-Specific Antibody Fragments (Fab).\n2. Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian administers this specific antidote, which binds directly to the cardiac glycosides circulating in the bloodstream, neutralizing them so they can no longer affect the heart1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Because the toxins in Oleander are structurally similar to the cardiac drug digoxin, this specific antidote is highly effective for Oleander poisoning1. Patients that develop severe signs of toxicosis but have access to this antidote have a guarded to good prognosis1.\n3. Cardiovascular Support and Arrhythmia Management\n1. Treatment name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Therapy and Cardiac Medications.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: IV fluids are administered to provide hemodynamic support and maintain blood pressure1. Specific medications are used to correct the life-threatening heart conditions caused by the poison: atropine or glycopyrrolate is administered to treat an abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia), and antiarrhythmics like lidocaine are used to manage irregular heart rhythms1.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Antiarrhythmic drugs are particularly critical to utilize if the specific Digoxin Immune Fab antidote is unavailable1.\n4. Electrolyte Monitoring and Correction\n1. Treatment name: Hyperkalemia Management.\n2. Brief description of the procedure: Oleander toxins cause an accumulation of extracellular potassium, so the cat's electrolytes must be closely monitored. Mild high potassium (hyperkalemia) can be managed with standard IV fluids, while severe hyperkalemia (> 7.5\u20139 mEq/L) requires active correction using sodium bicarbonate or a dextrose and insulin treatment12.\n3. Any situation-specific notes: Correcting this electrolyte imbalance is vital, as severe hyperkalemia directly contributes to the fatal cardiac arrhythmias associated with cardiac glycoside poisoning12."
