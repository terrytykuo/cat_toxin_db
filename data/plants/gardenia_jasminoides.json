Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides), also known as Cape Jasmine, is considered mildly toxic to cats. The symptoms are primarily gastrointestinal and dermatological in nature.\n1. Vomiting\n1. Symptom Name: Vomiting.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Not explicitly specified in the source, though gastrointestinal irritation typically occurs acutely after ingestion.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: This is a common sign of gastrointestinal upset caused by the plant's toxic compounds (genioposide and gardenoside). The reaction is generally self-limiting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Diarrhea\n1. Symptom Name: Diarrhea.\n2. Affected Body System: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Mild.\n4. Typical Onset Time: Not explicitly specified in the source.\n5. Additional Clinical Notes: Like vomiting, diarrhea is a result of the iridoid glycosides irritating the digestive tract. It usually resolves on its own but should be monitored.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n3. Hives and Skin Rash\n1. Symptom Name: Hives (Urticaria) or Skin Rash.\n2.

Additional Clinical Notes: Some cats may develop a dermatological reaction such as a rash or hives upon contact with the plant or after ingestion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\nGeneral Clinical Note: The toxicity of Gardenia is classified as mild. Most cases do not require aggressive veterinary intervention. Offering water and monitoring the cat is often sufficient, but if vomiting, diarrhea, or skin irritation persists or the cat appears very uncomfortable, veterinary advice should be sought1.",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides) is classified as a mildly toxic plant for cats. The reaction is generally self-limiting, and aggressive veterinary intervention is rarely required unless symptoms become persistent or severe.\nHere are the recommended treatments in order of priority:\n1. Home Monitoring and Hydration\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Supportive Care (Hydration and Observation).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The primary recommendation is to offer the cat water to ensure they stay hydrated, especially if they have vomited. Owners should closely monitor the cat for signs of continued distress, persistent vomiting, or worsening skin irritation.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because Gardenia toxicity is typically mild, most cats recover without the need for medical procedures. This step is often sufficient to manage the immediate after-effects of ingestion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Veterinary Symptomatic Management\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Symptomatic Relief (Consultation).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the cat displays persistent vomiting, diarrhea, or develops a skin rash (hives) that does not resolve, a veterinarian should be contacted for advice. While specific drugs are not listed in the source for Gardenia, standard veterinary care for these persistent symptoms typically involves medications to stop vomiting (anti-emetics) or soothe skin irritation.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Veterinary care is secondary and conditional; it is recommended specifically if \"vomiting or rash persists or the cat seems uncomfortable.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1"
