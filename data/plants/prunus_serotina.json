For each toxin provide: 1. Name of the compound. 2. Chemical formula (if available). 3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats. 4. Any notes on concentration or potency. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Cherry, Black Cherry, and Chokecherry (Prunus species) contain the following toxic compounds affecting cats:\n1. Cyanogenic Glycosides (Amygdalin)\n1. Name of the compound: The plants contain cyanogenic glycosides, specifically amygdalin (noted in the context of Prunus and related Rosaceae species like apples). Upon ingestion and breakdown, these compounds release cyanide (also referred to as hydrogen cyanide).\n2. Chemical formula: The sources explicitly provide the formula for the released toxin as HCN (Hydrogen Cyanide).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cellular Asphyxiation: When the plant parts (seeds, leaves, stems) are chewed or crushed, the glycosides interact with digestive enzymes to release cyanide.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Mitochondrial Inhibition: Cyanide is a potent cellular toxin that binds with ferric iron (Fe\n3+\n) in the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase within the mitochondria.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Oxygen Blockage: This binding disrupts the electron transport chain, effectively halting cellular respiration and preventing cells from using oxygen to generate energy (tissue hypoxia).\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 High Concentration: The toxins are concentrated in the seeds (pits), leaves, and stems.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Low Concentration: The fleshy fruit typically contains very low or negligible levels of cyanide and is generally considered safe if the pit is removed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency & Onset: Toxicity is rapid; clinical signs of cyanide poisoning (such as respiratory distress, bright red gums, and collapse) can appear within 10 to 60 minutes of ingestion. Death can occur quickly due to hypoxia.\nSources:\n\u2022 Houseplants and Ornamentals Toxic to Animals - Toxicology - Merck Veterinary Manual12\n\u2022 Clinical Perspectives on Feline Phytotoxicology34\n\u2022 Are Apple Cores And Seeds Safe For Pets?

Severity: mild, moderate, severe, or fatal. 4. Typical onset time (e.g. 'within 2 hours', '6\u201312 hours'). 5. Any additional clinical notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Cherry, Black Cherry, and Chokecherry (Prunus species) toxicity in cats is caused by cyanogenic glycosides found in the seeds (pits), leaves, and stems. Upon ingestion, these compounds release cyanide, which prevents cells from utilizing oxygen (cellular hypoxia).\nHere are the symptoms a cat may show after ingestion:\n1. Respiratory Distress\n1. Symptom name: Tachypnea (rapid breathing), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), or panting.\n2. Affected body system: Respiratory.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: 10\u201360 minutes (Symptoms develop very rapidly).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Because cyanide inhibits the body's ability to use oxygen at the cellular level, the cat will gasp for air or breathe rapidly in an attempt to compensate for tissue hypoxia.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2,3\n2. Brick Red Mucous Membranes\n1. Symptom name: Bright red gums (mucous membranes) and cherry-red blood coloring.\n2. Affected body system: Hematological / Circulatory.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: 10\u201360 minutes.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Unlike many conditions that cause pale or blue gums, cyanide poisoning causes the blood to be fully oxygenated (because cells cannot extract the oxygen), leading to a characteristic bright \"brick red\" color in the gums and tissues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3,2\n3. Neurological Collapse\n1. Symptom name: Seizures, tremors, dilated pupils, incoordination, and sudden collapse.\n2. Affected body system: Neurological.\n3. Severity: Severe to Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: 10\u201360 minutes.\n5. Additional clinical notes: As the brain is deprived of usable oxygen, the cat may exhibit severe neurological signs progressing rapidly to coma and death.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,3,4\n4. Cardiac Abnormalities\n1. Symptom name: Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) and hypotension (low blood pressure).\n2. Affected body system: Cardiac.\n3. Severity: Severe.\n4. Typical onset time: 10\u201360 minutes.\n5. Additional clinical notes: Cyanide toxicity can cause rapid shock and cardiac failure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1\n5. Gastrointestinal Upset\n1. Symptom name: Vomiting, diarrhea, and salivation.\n2. Affected body system: Gastrointestinal.\n3. Severity: Moderate.\n4. Typical onset time: 10\u201360 minutes (often the first sign before progression).\n5. Additional clinical notes: You may also detect an \"almond-flavored\" odor on the cat's breath. Gastrointestinal signs can also be caused by the physical irritation of the plant material.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,4,2\n6. Death\n1. Symptom name: Sudden death.\n2. Affected body system: Systemic (Multi-system failure).\n3. Severity: Fatal.\n4. Typical onset time: Rapid (often occurs before treatment can begin).\n5. Additional clinical notes: Due to the potency of cyanide and the speed of onset, death can occur quickly if the animal consumes a toxic dose of seeds or wilted leaves.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,5",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, particularly the Merck Veterinary Manual, Cherry, Black Cherry, and Chokecherry (Prunus species) contain cyanogenic glycosides. If a cat ingests the toxic parts (seeds/pits, leaves, or stems), these compounds release cyanide, which causes rapid and often fatal tissue hypoxia (lack of oxygen). Clinical signs can appear within 10 to 60 minutes, making immediate veterinary intervention critical.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Administration of Specific Antidotes\n\u2022 Treatment name: Cyanide Antidote Therapy (Sodium Nitrite, Sodium Thiosulfate, or Hydroxycobalamin).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Veterinarians may administer sodium nitrite to convert hemoglobin into cyanomethemoglobin (which binds cyanide), followed by sodium thiosulfate to convert the cyanide into thiocyanate, which is water-soluble and can be excreted in urine. Alternatively, hydroxycobalamin may be used; it combines with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12), which is also safely excreted in urine.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because cyanide toxicity acts rapidly (often leading to death before treatment can even begin), this specific antidote therapy is the most urgent intervention for a symptomatic cat. Sodium thiosulfate alone may be used in less severe cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n2. Oxygen Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment name: Oxygen Supplementation.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The administration of oxygen to the cat, typically via a mask or oxygen cage, to support the animal's respiratory system.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Cyanide prevents the body's cells from utilizing oxygen (cellular hypoxia), leading to respiratory distress. While the blood may remain bright red (oxygenated), the tissues are starving, making supportive oxygen therapy vital alongside antidotes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2,3,4\n3. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment name: Induction of Emesis and Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent and the cat is asymptomatic (not yet showing signs of poisoning), the vet may induce vomiting to remove the seeds or leaves. This is often followed by a dose of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind any remaining toxins in the gut.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Decontamination is generally performed only if the animal is stable. Inducing vomiting in a cat already experiencing seizures or respiratory distress is dangerous and typically avoided.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1\n4. Correction of Metabolic Acidosis\n\u2022 Treatment name: Sodium Bicarbonate Administration.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will monitor venous blood gas levels to check for metabolic acidosis (high acid levels in the blood). If severe acidosis is present, they will administer sodium bicarbonate to correct the pH balance.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Severe metabolic acidosis is a common and dangerous complication of cyanide toxicity that must be managed to prevent systemic failure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Source:1"
