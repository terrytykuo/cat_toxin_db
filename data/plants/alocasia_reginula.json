Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the Black Velvet Alocasia (Alocasia reginula) contains the following toxic compounds affecting cats:\n1. Insoluble Calcium Oxalate Crystals (Raphides)\n1. Name of the compound: Insoluble Calcium Oxalate Crystals.\n2. Chemical formula: Not explicitly listed in the text (Chemically represented as CaC\n2\n\t\u200b\n\nO\n4\n\t\u200b\n\n).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Mechanical Damage: These crystals form needle-like structures known as raphides. When a cat bites or chews into the plant tissue, specialized cells (idioblasts) forcefully eject these microscopic needles into the soft tissues of the mouth, tongue, and throat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Inflammatory Response: This penetration causes immediate and intense physical trauma, leading to severe burning, irritation, and swelling (edema) of the oral cavity and pharynx.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Distribution: These crystals are found in all parts of the plant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: The reaction is immediate and painful, often described as \"moderate\" severity because the intense pain typically prevents the cat from consuming a lethal amount. However, severe swelling can potentially obstruct the airway.\n2. Proteinaceous Toxins\n1. Name of the compound: Proteinaceous Toxins (or proteolytic enzymes).\n2. Chemical formula: Not applicable (complex proteins).\n3. Brief description of its mechanism of action in cats:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 The sources indicate that Alocasia species may contain proteinaceous toxins alongside the oxalate crystals. These toxins are released when the plant is damaged and can exacerbate the inflammatory response caused by the crystals, contributing to the intense pain and swelling.\n4. Notes on concentration or potency:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Distribution: Present in leaves, stems, and tubers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: These compounds work synergistically with the calcium oxalate crystals to increase the severity of the irritation.\nSources:\n\u2022 Cat toxicity chart for 50 popular houseplants1\n\u2022 Houseplants and Ornamentals Toxic to Animals - Toxicology - Merck Veterinary Manual23",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Black Velvet Alocasia (Alocasia reginula) contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Veterinary treatment focuses on managing the immediate oral pain and swelling, as systemic toxicity is rare.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Oral Decontamination (Rinsing)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The cat's mouth is thoroughly rinsed or wiped out with water to remove any remaining plant material and the microscopic needle-like crystals (raphides) causing the irritation.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: This is the immediate first step to stop the crystals from causing further physical trauma to the soft tissues of the mouth and throat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n2. Airway Management\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian monitors for laryngeal edema (swelling of the throat). In severe cases, they may provide oxygen support or secure an airway (intubation) to ensure the cat can breathe.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: While the overall toxicity is often rated as moderate, there is a specific risk that swelling in the back of the throat could obstruct breathing. Immediate intervention is required if the cat shows signs of respiratory distress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:1,2\n3. Administration of Calcium-Containing Liquids (Demulcents)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Feeding the cat small amounts of milk, yogurt, or other calcium-containing dairy products.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: The calcium in these products binds to the insoluble oxalate crystals, which helps precipitate them and aids in clearing them from the oral cavity and esophagus, providing soothing relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:2\n4. Symptomatic Supportive Care (Analgesics & Fluids)\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: Administering pain medication (analgesics) to control severe oral discomfort and fluid therapy if the cat is dehydrated from excessive drooling or vomiting.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Analgesics are indicated because the pain from the crystals is immediate and intense. Most cases recover without extensive intervention, but pain relief helps the cat return to eating and drinking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Sources:3,2"
