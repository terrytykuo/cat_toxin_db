(e.g. leaves, bulbs, flowers, pollen, stems, roots, seeds, bark, sap, fruit, entire plant). Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, the toxicity of Grapes, Raisins, and Currants (Zante currants) to cats is specifically associated with the fruit itself.\n\u2022 Fruit (Fresh and Dried): The flesh and skin of the grape are toxic. This applies to all forms, including fresh grapes, dried raisins, sultanas, and currants (which are dried small grapes). Ingestion of even a small amount can lead to serious health issues.\n\u2022 Toxic Compound: Recent research suggests tartaric acid (and its salt, potassium bitartrate) is the likely toxic principle. This compound is found within the fruit.\n\u2022 Other Parts: The sources do not explicitly list the leaves, stems, or roots of the grapevine (Vitis species) as toxic to cats in the same manner as the fruit, though they are not specifically cleared as safe in these texts. The warnings focus exclusively on the ingestion of the fruit and its dried forms.\nSources:\n\u2022 10 Foods that are Dangerous for Cats | Anicira1\n\u2022 Clinical Perspectives on Feline Phytotoxicology2,3\n\u2022 Dangerous Foods for Cats4\n\u2022 Household Hazards: Toxic Hazards for Cats5\n\u2022 What Can't Cats Eat? 8 Toxic Foods for Cats6",

List them in order of priority (most urgent first). For each treatment provide: 1. Treatment name. 2. Brief description of the procedure. 3. Any situation-specific notes. Cite your sources.\n============================================================\n\nBased on the provided sources, Grapes, Raisins, and Currants contain tartaric acid, which can cause acute kidney failure in cats12. Immediate veterinary intervention is required, as the condition can be fatal if not treated promptly3.\nHere are the recommended veterinary treatments in order of priority:\n1. Gastrointestinal Decontamination\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Induction of Emesis (Vomiting) and Administration of Activated Charcoal.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: If the ingestion was recent, the veterinarian will administer prescription medication to induce vomiting, removing the fruit from the stomach before the toxins are fully absorbed45. This is typically followed by the administration of activated charcoal (often with a cathartic) to bind any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and prevent them from entering the bloodstream56.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Owners should not attempt to induce vomiting at home using salt or hydrogen peroxide, as this is unsafe for cats and can cause severe injury or poisoning4. This procedure is most effective when performed within hours of ingestion78.\n2. Aggressive Fluid Therapy\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Intravenous (IV) Fluid Diuresis.\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinarian will administer IV fluids to correct dehydration and, crucially, to support the kidneys. Fluid therapy helps to \"flush\" the kidneys (diuresis), maintaining urine production and helping to clear toxins from the body910.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Because grapes and raisins target the kidneys, fluid therapy is essential to prevent the onset of anuria (the cessation of urine production), which is a fatal complication of acute renal failure1011. Treatment may need to continue for 48 to 72 hours to ensure the kidneys are protected10.\n3. Baseline Blood Work and Monitoring\n\u2022 Treatment Name: Renal Function Monitoring (Biochemistry Profile).\n\u2022 Brief description of the procedure: The veterinary team will run blood tests to establish baseline levels for kidney function, specifically checking creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and electrolyte levels5. These tests are repeated (often every 24 hours) to track the progression of the toxicity or the success of the treatment10.\n\u2022 Situation-specific notes: Clinical signs of kidney failure from grapes may not appear immediately; vomiting often starts within 12 hours, but severe renal failure markers may take 24 hours to days to manifest512. Therefore, monitoring is critical even if the cat appears fine initially3."
