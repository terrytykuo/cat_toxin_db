Inducing Vomiting: A veterinarian may medically induce vomiting to remove the toxic substance from the cat's stomach2. Situation-specific note: You should never attempt to induce vomiting at home (such as by using hydrogen peroxide) without professional advice, as you risk injuring your cat or yourself3.\n2. Fluid Therapy: The veterinarian may administer fluid therapy to support the cat's system2.\n3. Monitoring and Preventative Care: In some instances, the veterinarian will closely monitor the cat for any signs of trouble and provide symptomatic treatment if or when necessary to prevent further issues from occurring2.\nBecause the provided sources lack the specific, prioritized treatment steps and clinical notes for Morning Glory toxicity, would you like me to run a fast web search to find the exact veterinary medical protocols for treating Morning Glory ingestion in cats?"
