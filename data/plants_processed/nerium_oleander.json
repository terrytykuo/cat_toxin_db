      "description": "in cats: Cardiac glycosides directly interfere with the heart\u2019s electrical system and muscle contractions12. They do this by inhibiting the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase pump within the cells34. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium, which subsequently causes a rapid increase in intracellular calcium34. This severe disruption of normal electrical conduction forces the cat's cardiac muscle contractions to become much more forceful, yet slower, resulting in life-threatening heart arrhythmias, low blood pressure, and potential cardiovascular collapse",
      "concentration_notes": "Oleander is considered to be among the absolute most toxic plants that contain cardiac glycosides and possesses an extremely narrow margin of safety46. All parts of the plant are highly poisonous, and the toxins are so potent and concentrated that even drinking a small amount of the water from a vase or plant base holding oleander can cause severe toxicity1....

This is followed by administering an antiemetic and a dose of activated charcoal with a cathartic (to bind the toxins and speed their exit through the digestive tract)",
      "notes": "Because cardiac glycosides undergo enterohepatic recirculation (meaning the toxins are repeatedly reabsorbed by the liver and intestines), the activated charcoal treatment must be repeated every 6 to 8 hours for a total of 3 doses (with the subsequent doses given without a cathartic)1.\n2.

Mild high potassium (hyperkalemia) can be managed with standard IV fluids, while severe hyperkalemia (> 7.5\u20139 mEq/L) requires active correction using sodium bicarbonate or a dextrose and insulin treatment",
