    "description": "Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: Tradescantia zebrina is a fast-growing, creeping evergreen vine with fleshy stems. It is highly prized for its striking, colorful foliage. The leaves are lance-shaped or ovate, featuring distinctive zebra-like longitudinal stripes of silvery-white and green on the upper surface, with a vibrant, deep magenta or solid purple underside. It occasionally produces small, three-petaled pink or purplish flowers.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to the wetlands and rainforests of Mexico, Central America, and Colombia, it thrives in warm, humid, and tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Today, it is extremely common worldwide as a decorative indoor houseplant (often grown in hanging baskets so its vines can trail). In frost-free, warm climates, it is also widely planted outdoors as an aggressive, colorful ground cover."

If ingested, the sap causes mild gastrointestinal distress, leading to symptoms like drooling, vomiting, and diarrhea1. If the sap gets on the cat's fur and makes prolonged contact with the skin, it acts as a dermal irritant, causing redness and itching",

The toxic compounds are concentrated specifically within the plant's sap, which is found in the leaves and stems1.
