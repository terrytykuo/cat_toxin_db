Angel's Trumpets contain tropane alkaloids (though not explicitly named in the provided text, the symptoms of dilated pupils and hyperthermia are consistent with this). Treatments for solanine poisoning (such as using atropine) would be inappropriate and dangerous for Angel's Trumpet ingestion, which already presents with atropine-like effects (fast heart rate, dilated pupils). Therefore, rely strictly on the specific advice for Brugmansia or Angel's Trumpets: immediate veterinary care.",
