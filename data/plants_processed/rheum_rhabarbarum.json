      "description": "in cats: Unlike insoluble oxalates (which primarily cause localized mouth pain), soluble oxalates are absorbed directly from the gastrointestinal tract into the cat's bloodstream12. Once in the blood, these oxalate salts bind aggressively with the body's systemic calcium, resulting in a sudden and dangerous drop in blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia)23. The crystals formed by this binding process can also lodge in the kidneys, which can rarely lead to acute renal (kidney) failure",
      "concentration_notes": "Soluble oxalates are present in varying degrees throughout all parts of the rhubarb plant2. However, the toxins are most highly concentrated in the leaves14. While the stalks (stems) contain a significantly lower concentration of oxalates\u2014which is why humans can safely eat them\u2014they are still considered risky for cats14. Small animals like cats can suffer severe poisoning if they ingest these compounds in large enough quantities"
