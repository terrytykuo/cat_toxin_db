      "description": "in cats: These needle-like crystals are bundled inside specialized plant cells known as idioblasts34. When a cat bites, chews, or crushes the plant material, these cells are ruptured and the sharp crystals are forcefully ejected into the cat's oral mucosa and surrounding tissues34. Instead of a systemic chemical poisoning, this acts as a severe mechanical irritant, causing immediate physical trauma, intense pain, and inflammation to the mouth, tongue, throat, and gastrointestinal tract",
      "concentration_notes": "These crystals are distributed throughout all parts of the Monstera plant, and the toxicity is generally classified as \"moderate\"12. Because the intense burning and pain are immediate upon chewing, it typically stops the cat from consuming a large amount of the plant35. Consequently, ingestion is rarely fatal, though in severe cases, the resulting inflammatory swelling in the mouth and throat can be dangerous and potentially obstruct the cat's airway"

It is required if the physical trauma from the sharp calcium oxalate crystals triggers an extreme inflammatory response, causing the cat's mouth, tongue, and throat (laryngeal edema) to swell enough to obstruct their airway1....\n2.

Additionally, the vet (or the owner at home) may offer a small amount of milk, yogurt, or other calcium-containing dairy products; the calcium binds to the insoluble oxalate crystals, which helps clear them from the mouth and esophagus while soothing the irritation",
      "notes": "This is the immediate first line of defense to stop the intense burning and pain4. Most cases of Monstera exposure have an excellent prognosis and resolve fully with this simple decontamination, often without needing further veterinary intervention4.\n3.
