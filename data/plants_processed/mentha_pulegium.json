Because the cat's body cannot process them, the compounds accumulate and cause systemic poisoning. While many mints mainly cause gastrointestinal irritation, the compounds in Pennyroyal are exceptionally severe and attack the liver, leading to liver damage, liver failure, seizures, and potentially death",

Additionally, the risk is heavily dependent on concentration; extracted essential oils are far more potent and dangerous than the raw plant. Highly concentrated oils can cause severe, life-threatening toxicity through ingestion, inhalation (such as from a diffuser), or even direct absorption through the skin"

There are no safe over-the-counter products for inducing vomiting in cats, and doing it yourself can cause significant injury, aspiration, or worsen the poisoning23.

      "notes": "Unlike common garden mints that may only cause mild stomach upset, Pennyroyal is highly toxic and is specifically known to cause severe, potentially fatal liver damage and failure4.... Due to the severe nature of Pennyroyal poisoning, the cat will require hospitalization alongside the fluid therapy for close, continuous monitoring12.\n3.

      "notes": "These medications are crucial for keeping the cat as comfortable as possible while they weather the episode of illness and gastrointestinal distress caused by the mint's volatile oils1. Depending on the extent of the liver or neurological damage caused by the Pennyroyal, other targeted symptomatic treatments may also be introduced as needed",
