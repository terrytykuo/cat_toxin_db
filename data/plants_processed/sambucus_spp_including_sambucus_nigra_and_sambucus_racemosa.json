Sodium nitrite helps convert hemoglobin to cyanomethemoglobin (which binds cyanide), followed by sodium thiosulfate, which converts cyanide into thiocyanate (a less toxic substance excreted in urine). Alternatively, hydroxycobalamin may be used to bind cyanide to form Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), which is then excreted.",
