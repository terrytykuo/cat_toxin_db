    "description": "Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: This is a bulbous perennial plant characterized by narrow, grass-like green leaves. It is best known for producing clusters (umbels) of bright, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring. A distinguishing feature of this plant is the prominent green stripe running down the outside (back) of each of its six white petals.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, the Star of Bethlehem is highly adaptable and has naturalized across much of North America. It is commonly found growing in meadows, woodland edges, lawns, pastures, and along roadsides, and it is frequently cultivated in home gardens as an ornamental spring-blooming flower."

      "name": "Cardiac glycosides",
      "chemical_formula": "Not provided in the given sources.",
      "description": "in cats: Cardiac glycosides interfere with the heart's electrical system by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which is necessary for normal cardiac function23. This inhibition causes intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium to accumulate, which subsequently leads to a rise in intracellular calcium23. These changes severely alter cardiac muscle contractions and electrical conduction, causing the heart to beat more forcefully but at a slower rate, and frequently resulting in life-threatening arrhythmias and hyperkalemia",
      "concentration_notes": "Plants containing cardiac glycosides are among the most toxic to pets and have a very narrow margin of safety, meaning there is no safe level of ingestion12. Furthermore, cats are believed to be more sensitive to cardiac glycoside toxicity than dogs3. While the sources note that oleander and foxglove are considered the most toxic plants in this specific category, the cardiac glycosides found in the Star of Bethlehem are still highly dangerous and can be fatal"

      "notes": "This intervention is ideally performed while the patient is still asymptomatic2. Because cardiac glycosides undergo enterohepatic recirculation (recirculating between the liver and intestines), the veterinarian will likely repeat the activated charcoal administration (without a cathartic) every 6\u20138 hours for a total of three doses2.\n2.
