      "description": "in cats: The mechanism of action is primarily physical trauma. These microscopic, needle-like crystals are bundled together inside specialized plant cells known as idioblasts3. When a cat bites, chews, or crushes the leaves or stems of the Pothos plant, these cells forcefully eject the sharp crystals directly into the cat's oral mucosa and surrounding tissues23. This microscopic piercing causes immediate, intense burning pain and inflammation in the mouth, lips, and tongue1.... The body's inflammatory response leads to excessive drooling and swelling, which in severe cases can cause laryngeal edema (swelling of the throat) that may potentially obstruct the cat's airway",
      "concentration_notes": "Pothos toxicity is generally classified as moderate1. The insoluble oxalate crystals are scattered throughout the entire plant45. However, because the crystals cause such immediate and intense pain the second the cat bites into the plant, the animal is usually deterred from eating large quantities24. As a result, Pothos poisonings are rarely fatal, and full recovery is typically expected"

When a cat bites or chews the leaves or stems, these crystals are forcefully ejected directly into the oral mucosa2. Because the pain is instantaneous, cats are usually deterred from consuming a large amount of the plant, meaning fatalities are extremely rare23.\n2. Excessive Drooling (Hypersalivation)"

      "notes": "This is an immediate first-aid step to stop the ongoing microscopic trauma to the cat's tissues. You should never induce vomiting for Pothos ingestion unless specifically instructed by a vet, as bringing the sharp crystals back up can cause further severe pain and damage to the esophagus3.\n3.

      "notes": "Because the intense pain usually deters the cat from eating a large amount of the plant, full systemic poisoning is highly unlikely. Most cases of Pothos exposure have a good to excellent prognosis and the cat is expected to make a full recovery, often needing only at-home monitoring after the initial decontamination1. Always consult a veterinarian or pet poison hotline to determine exactly how much monitoring or medical support your specific cat needs",
