When ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin, pine essential oils can act as a direct irritant to the gastrointestinal tract, causing drooling and vomiting1. If absorbed systemically, the oils can cause severe organ damage, specifically liver damage, which can lead to seizures and even death",

Live pine trees (such as those used for Christmas trees) contain very low concentrations of these essential oils and are typically not expected to result in major or life-threatening toxicity1.
