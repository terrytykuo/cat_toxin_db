    "description": "Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: The Oyster Plant is a low-growing, clump-forming evergreen perennial. It is highly prized for its striking, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a dense rosette pattern. The leaves are typically a glossy dark green on the top and a vibrant, deep purple on the underside. It produces small, three-petaled white flowers that bloom tucked inside distinctive, boat-shaped purple bracts (which gives the plant its other popular nickname, \"Moses-in-the-Cradle\").\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to southern Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala, the Oyster Plant thrives in warm, tropical, and subtropical climates. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Today, it is widely cultivated globally and is very commonly found indoors as a decorative houseplant, or planted outdoors as a colorful ground cover or border plant in frost-free regions."

When a cat bites or chews the plant, the sap is released, causing immediate irritation to the oral mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract, which leads to drooling and vomiting1.
