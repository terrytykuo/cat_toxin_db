      "description": "in cats: When a cat chews, grinds, or crushes the plant material, the cyanogenic glycosides are altered and release toxic cyanide into the body2. Once absorbed, the cyanide binds to ferric iron (Fe\n3+\n), specifically inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase24. This interference halts cellular respiration, completely preventing the cells from utilizing oxygen and resulting in rapid, life-threatening tissue hypoxia (oxygen deprivation)",
      "concentration_notes": "The toxic cyanogenic glycosides are generally concentrated within the leaves of the plant and the seeds of its fruit2. Severe toxicity is relatively uncommon unless a large amount of the plant is ingested2. Furthermore, the seeds must be physically compromised to pose a danger; if a cat swallows a seed completely whole without chewing it, the cyanide is not released and toxicity is not expected"

This typically involves using sodium nitrite (which binds with cyanide to form cyanomethemoglobin) followed by sodium thiosulfate (which converts the toxin into water-soluble thiocyanate that is safely excreted in the urine)4. Alternatively, the vet may use hydroxycobalamin, which combines with cyanide to form vitamin B",
      "notes": "This is the most urgent life-saving intervention for a cat showing clinical signs of large-dose poisoning (such as respiratory distress, cherry-red blood/gums, seizures, or collapse)3.

This is followed by administering a single dose of activated charcoal alongside a cathartic to bind to any unabsorbed toxins in the digestive tract",
      "notes": "Decontamination should only be performed on asymptomatic patients. If the cat only ingested a very small amount of the plant, severe toxicity is less likely, and the cat might ultimately only require minimal gastrointestinal support4.\n3. Systemic Metabolic Support and Monitoring",

If acidosis is present, it is corrected by intravenously administering sodium bicarbonate",
      "notes": "Alongside blood gas monitoring, the veterinarian may also draw a whole blood cyanide level to definitively confirm the diagnosis",
