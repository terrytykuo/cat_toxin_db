Clinical signs include excessive drooling (hypersalivation), slow heart rate (bradycardia), muscle tremors, and neurological disturbances34.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cell Membrane Disruption (Cytotoxicity): The toxin interacts with cell membranes, increasing their permeability and leading to cell destruction.
