However, the toxicity is dose-dependent\u2014ingesting large amounts of the plant can lead to liver damage3. Furthermore, concentrated forms, such as extracted mint essential oils, are highly toxic and far more dangerous, where even a very small amount or indirect exposure can cause severe neurological, respiratory, or liver issues"
