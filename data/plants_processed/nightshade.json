      "description": "in cats: These toxins harm cats through several severe systemic mechanisms:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cytotoxic effect: Solanine interacts with the phospholipids in cell membranes, increasing permeability and causing cell destruction. This particularly damages the intestinal epithelial cells, causing severe gastrointestinal irritation, inflammation, vomiting, and diarrhea3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Neurological disruption: It inhibits acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine. This causes an overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to salivation, an abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia), muscle tremors, and seizures45.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Mitochondrial impairment: It disrupts the energy balance of cells by inhibiting the respiratory chain, leading to lethargy and weakness6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Red blood cell destruction: In severe cases, it can cause hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells), leading to anemia and subsequent kidney damage57.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Feline-specific vulnerability: Cats are particularly sensitive to these toxins because their livers lack the glucuronidation pathways needed to efficiently detoxify and process them, resulting in prolonged and more severe illness",
      "concentration_notes": "Solanine is heavily concentrated in the green parts of nightshade plants, such as unripe fruits, green potato skins, potato sprouts (eyes), leaves, and stems1.... Ripe fruits and cooked/peeled potatoes contain only trace amounts and are generally tolerable"

      "description": "in cats: Tomatine acts as a natural defense mechanism against pests913. Similar to solanine, cats lack the specific enzymes required to efficiently break this compound down13. Ingestion leads to gastrointestinal distress, lethargy, and in extreme cases, heart rate irregularities",
      "concentration_notes": "Tomatine is highest in concentration in the leaves, stems, and unripe (green) tomatoes912. Fully ripe red tomatoes contain negligible levels of tomatine and pose no meaningful threat9.... It is generally considered slightly less toxic than solanine, requiring very large doses to cause severe systemic illness"
