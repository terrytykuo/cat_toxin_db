The plant typically features two or three basal leaves that grow up to 30 cm long1. It produces a leafless stem bearing a one-sided cluster (raceme) of nodding, white, bell-shaped flowers that are highly aromatic1. Though it seldom forms, the plant can also produce a red berry as fruit1.\n\u2022 Habitat and Common Locations: It is a popular ornamental perennial grown in gardens and yards35. Because of its beautiful and fragrant blooms, it is also very commonly brought indoors in cut flower arrangements and bouquets"

This inhibition causes an increase in intracellular sodium, which subsequently triggers an increase in intracellular calcium3. This cellular disruption significantly alters electrical conduction and how the cardiac muscle contracts, leading to profound cardiovascular depression, severe cardiac arrhythmias, a sudden drop in heart rate (bradycardia), and potentially seizures2....\n4. Notes on",
      "concentration_notes": "The plant contains roughly 38 different cardiac glycosides, making it powerfully toxic despite its dainty appearance46. These toxins are heavily concentrated throughout all parts of the plant (including the bulb, roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves, and flowers) and will even leach into the water of a vase holding the cut flowers"

This is followed by administering a dose of activated charcoal with a cathartic to bind any remaining toxins in the gut.",
