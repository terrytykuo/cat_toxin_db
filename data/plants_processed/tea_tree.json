Botanical Family Tea Tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) belongs to the Myrtaceae (Myrtle) family.\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: The Tea Tree is a small evergreen tree or tall shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 20 feet (6 meters). It is easily identified by its whitish, papery bark that peels off in layers. The plant features narrow, soft, needle-like leaves that are highly aromatic when crushed, and it blooms with fluffy, white, bottlebrush-like flower spikes.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native exclusively to Australia, the Tea Tree naturally thrives in swampy, poorly drained, and low-lying coastal areas, primarily along streams in New South Wales and Queensland. Today, it is widely cultivated in commercial plantations specifically for the extraction of tea tree essential oil from its leaves."

      "description": "in cats: As noted in our previous discussions regarding essential oil toxicity, cats lack the specific liver enzymes required to safely metabolize and break down these volatile compounds. When a cat is exposed to tea tree oil\u2014whether through ingestion from grooming, direct skin absorption, or inhalation\u2014the compounds quickly enter the bloodstream. Because the cat's liver cannot efficiently process them, the toxins accumulate in the body. This accumulation causes central nervous system depression, hypothermia, and potential liver injury.",
      "concentration_notes": "Essential oils are highly potent, concentrated plant extracts. As previously established, using essential oils \"neat\" (undiluted) on or around a cat is extremely dangerous. Because cats are uniquely sensitive to these specific compounds, even minor or indirect exposure can be hazardous and lead to rapid toxicity."
