While they often grow long and low to the ground, the plants can reach over 3 feet in height3.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: In the wild, mint plants thrive in damp environments and are typically found growing near sources of water4. They grow wild all over the United States3. Because they are widely used for culinary and medicinal purposes, they are also very commonly found cultivated in outdoor herb gardens or grown indoors as kitchen houseplants"

Because the cat's body cannot process them, the oils act as a direct gastrointestinal irritant and can relax the esophageal valve, making vomiting likely56. If absorbed systemically, the toxins overwhelm the liver and central nervous system, which can cause liver damage, neurological issues (like tremors or seizures), and respiratory distress3.... Interestingly, menthol mimics the effects of nepetalactone (the active compound in catnip), which can confusingly attract some cats to peppermint even though it is harmful",

The raw plant (fresh peppermint leaves) is generally considered mildly toxic; a cat would usually need to ingest a large quantity to experience more than mild stomach upset5.... However, concentrated forms such as peppermint essential oil are extremely toxic and highly potent911. Exposure to concentrated peppermint oil\u2014whether ingested, inhaled from a diffuser, or absorbed through the skin\u2014is highly dangerous and can quickly lead to severe, life-threatening symptoms"
