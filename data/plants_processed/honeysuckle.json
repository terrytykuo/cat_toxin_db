Tatarian honeysuckle (Lonicera tatarica) is listed as a safe alternative to catnip and produces a similar euphoric behavioral reaction, often found in cat toys2. However, general garden Honeysuckle appears on toxic plant lists, so treating ingestion as a potential poisoning until confirmed otherwise is the safest course of action",
