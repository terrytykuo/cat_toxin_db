However, when the apricot pit (seed) is chewed, crushed, or digested, amygdalin interacts with digestive enzymes and undergoes hydrolysis, releasing hydrogen cyanide into the bloodstream12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Cellular Asphyxiation: Once released, cyanide acts as a potent cellular toxin. It binds tightly to ferric (Fe3+) iron within cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme in the mitochondria34.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Respiratory Arrest: This binding disrupts the electron transport chain and halts cellular respiration. Consequently, the cat's cells are unable to utilize oxygen to generate energy (ATP), leading to tissue hypoxia (oxygen starvation) and rapid systemic failure, even though the blood is fully oxygenated35.\n4.

The flesh of the fruit contains only trace or negligible amounts and is generally considered safe17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Bioavailability: The hard outer pit must be broken (chewed or crushed) to release the toxin. Swallowing a seed whole often prevents the release of cyanide4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: While the seeds contain \"trace amounts\" of cyanide compounds that may not be harmful in small normal quantities, ingesting large quantities can be dangerous7. However, cyanide is described as a \"potent cellular toxin,\" and clinical signs can develop rapidly (within 10\u201360 minutes) leading to shock and death if untreated"
