They are characterized by fleshy, opposite leaves that have serrate (saw-toothed) or crenate (scalloped) margins1. They are often winter-flowering, producing bright blooms in colors such as red, orange, or pink arranged in umbels (clusters)1. As the plant ages, the stems often become woody and untidy1.\n\u2022 Common Locations: They are commonly found as houseplants or garden ornamentals12. Other common names include Cathedral bells"
