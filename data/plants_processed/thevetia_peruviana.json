    "description": "The sources do not contain information about the plant's botanical family, detailed physical appearance, or habitat.\n(Please note that the following information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it):\n1. Botanical Family The Yellow Oleander belongs to the dogbane family, Apocynaceae (the same family as the common pink/white oleander, Nerium oleander).\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: Yellow Oleander is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub or small tree that can reach up to 10 to 20 feet in height. It features spirally arranged, narrow, willow-like, glossy green leaves. It is heavily prized for its fragrant, funnel- or trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow (but can also be pale orange or peach). After flowering, it produces distinctively shaped, fleshy, somewhat triangular or globular seed pods that start green and turn black as they ripen.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to tropical regions of the Americas (ranging from Mexico into Central and South America), it thrives in full sun and well-draining soils. Because it is highly drought-tolerant and features striking flowers, it is widely cultivated globally and is very commonly found planted as an ornamental shrub, hedge, or street tree in warm, tropical, and subtropical climates."

      "description": "in cats: Cardiac glycosides directly interfere with the electrical signaling and muscle contractions of the cat's heart13. They do this by inhibiting the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase pump, which is a necessary component for normal cardiac function35. This inhibition causes an accumulation of intracellular sodium (Na\n+\n) and extracellular potassium (K\n+\n), which subsequently leads to a dangerous rise in intracellular calcium (Ca\n++\n)35. The result is that the heart's contractions become more forceful but abnormally slow (bradycardia), eventually leading to life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) and potential cardiovascular collapse",
      "concentration_notes": "Cardiac glycosides are extremely potent and have a very narrow margin of safety6. Because the toxins are so powerful, there is no safe level of ingestion; even a very small amount of the plant\u2014or simply drinking the water from a plant base or vase\u2014can be fatal to cats23. While the toxins are present in all parts of the plant, they are highly concentrated and can cause a rapid onset of severe gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms"
