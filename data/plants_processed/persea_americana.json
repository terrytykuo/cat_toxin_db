The plant produces inconspicuous yellow-green flowers arranged in panicles. The fruit is a berry that is ovoid or pear-shaped (pyriform), featuring a thick, leathery, glossy dark green skin, lime-green to yellow flesh, and a single, smooth, ovoid seed1.\n\u2022 Habitat and Location: There are three commonly cultivated races of avocado: Mexican, Guatemalan, and West Indies1.
