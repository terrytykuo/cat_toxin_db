It tightly binds to ferric (Fe3+) iron within cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme in the mitochondria1....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Oxygen Starvation: This binding disrupts the final step of the electron transport chain, preventing cells from utilizing oxygen to generate energy (ATP). This leads to tissue hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) and cellular death, even though the blood is fully oxygenated1....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Feline Susceptibility: Cats are noted to lack certain enzymes required to break down such toxins effectively, making them particularly susceptible to toxicity due to their metabolic limitations and small body size78.\n4.

The seed must be crushed or chewed to pose a significant threat3....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Potency: While the amount of cyanide in a single seed is described as \"trace\" or \"minuscule\"1213, the toxin itself is \"highly toxic\" and potent214. Because cats are small, even small amounts of toxin can have a significant impact, though a single seed is unlikely to cause immediate harm415. Estimates for \"small pets\" suggest symptoms might appear after ingesting around 200 seeds, but any exposure is discouraged due to the rapid onset of severe symptoms like respiratory distress and shock"
