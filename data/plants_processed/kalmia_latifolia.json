      "description": "in cats: Grayanotoxins bind to and modify the sodium channels in cell membranes, preventing them from closing14. This allows continuous calcium movement into the cells, resulting in a prolonged depolarization of excitable cells15. This severely disrupts normal electrical signaling, particularly affecting the cat's nerve, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle cells",

      "notes": "These are generally the most common and earliest signs of grayanotoxin poisoning14. If a cat only ingests a small amount of the plant (a few leaves or petals), the clinical signs are typically limited to these gastrointestinal effects and mild central nervous system depression3.\n2.

In some cases, a gastric lavage (stomach pump) and saline cathartics may be utilized",
      "notes": "Inducing vomiting should only be performed if the cat is asymptomatic or neurologically appropriate (to prevent accidental aspiration into the lungs). Because this specific plant material can sit in the stomach for many hours, inducing vomiting can still be highly successful even several hours after ingestion3.\n2.

Specific medications are used to correct heart abnormalities, such as atropine for an abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia), or antiarrhythmics (like lidocaine and procainamide) for irregular heart rhythms. Calcium injections may also be used",
