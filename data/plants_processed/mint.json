They produce flowers that grow in clusters on stalks and range in color from lavender to white2. While some mint plants can reach over 3 feet in height, they often grow long and low to the ground2.\n\u2022 Habitat and Common Locations: In the wild, mint grows abundantly all over the United States, particularly thriving in damp locations and near sources of water23. Additionally, it is a very popular cultivated plant, commonly found in outdoor herb gardens or grown indoors in kitchens for its culinary and medicinal uses"

      "description": "in cats: Menthol stimulates a cat's olfactory receptors, which can mimic the behavioral effects of nepetalactone (the safe compound found in catnip)12. However, cats lack the necessary liver enzymes to safely process and metabolize mint plant oils like menthol4. Because it cannot be broken down, it acts as an irritant to the cat's gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system",
      "concentration_notes": "A tiny taste of fresh leaves containing menthol typically only causes mild stomach upset7. However, highly concentrated forms\u2014such as extracted peppermint essential oil\u2014are extremely dangerous and can lead to severe respiratory distress, neurological issues, and liver damage"

In the digestive tract, these specific oils have been known to relax the esophageal valve, making vomiting much more likely12. Systemically, the accumulation of these unprocessed oils stresses the liver and can cause central nervous system issues like lethargy, weakness, and uncoordinated gait",
      "concentration_notes": "The risk level is highly dependent on concentration7. While sniffing a mint plant or eating a small leaf might just cause coughing, sneezing, or mild drooling, exposure to concentrated essential oils (whether ingested, applied to the skin, or inhaled from a diffuser) is highly toxic and can trigger liver failure and severe neurological symptoms"
