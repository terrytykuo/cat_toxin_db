From this stem grow pinnately compound leaves that are typically about 60 cm (approximately 2 feet) long. The plant produces cones containing inch-long, shiny, orange-red seeds1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Habitat and Location: It is commonly found in and is native to Florida (where it is also known as Florida arrowroot or Seminole bread)"
