It is easily recognizable by its long, cascading, thin stems adorned with small, spherical, fleshy green leaves that resemble peas or small pearls. The plant occasionally blooms with small, white, brush-like flowers that are known to smell faintly of cinnamon.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to the dry, arid, and semi-desert regions of southwestern Africa (primarily South Africa and Namibia), its trailing stems typically grow low along the ground in the wild, taking root where they touch the soil and forming dense, creeping mats to avoid direct, harsh sunlight. Today, it is most commonly found worldwide as a highly popular ornamental indoor houseplant, frequently displayed in hanging baskets so its string-like stems can dramatically cascade over the edges."
