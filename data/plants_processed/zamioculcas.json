    "description": "Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: The ZZ Plant is a tropical evergreen subshrub known for its thick, fleshy, upright stems and incredibly glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. It grows from stout, potato-like underground rhizomes that store water, which makes the plant highly resilient.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: It is originally native to the dry grasslands, rocky areas, and forests of Eastern and Southern Africa (stretching from Kenya down to South Africa), where it is adapted to survive long periods of drought. Today, it is most commonly found worldwide as a highly popular indoor houseplant because it is exceptionally low-maintenance, requiring very little water and tolerating low-light indoor environments very well."

      "chemical_formula": "Not provided in the sources.",
      "description": "in cats: Rather than acting as a systemic chemical poison, these toxins act as mechanical irritants. The microscopic, needle-like crystals are bundled and stored inside specialized plant cells called idioblasts23. When a cat bites or chews on the plant material, the cells break and forcefully eject the sharp crystals into the cat's oral mucosa and surrounding tissues23. This causes immediate, intense tissue trauma, burning, and inflammation in the mouth, tongue, and throat",
      "concentration_notes": "The crystals are distributed throughout all parts of the ZZ Plant1. The plant's overall toxicity level is considered mild [369, Conversation History]. Because the sharp crystals cause immediate and intense pain upon chewing, cats are usually deterred from eating large quantities of the plant4. Therefore, the toxic effects are typically limited to excessive drooling, mouth irritation, reluctance to eat, and possible vomiting"
