    "description": "However, the sources do not provide details regarding its botanical family, the physical appearance of the plant itself, or its natural habitat.\nI can provide the answers to your questions using information from outside of the given sources (please note that this information is not from your sources and you may want to independently verify it):\n1. Botanical Family Starfruit (Averrhoa carambola) belongs to the Oxalidaceae (wood sorrel) family.\n2. Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: The starfruit plant grows as a small, bushy, multi-trunked evergreen tree that typically reaches 15 to 30 feet in height. It has a rounded canopy with drooping branches and bushy, compound (pinnate) green leaves that fold up at night or when touched. The tree blooms with clusters of small, bell-shaped, pink to lavender flowers. The waxy, yellow-to-orange fruit has five or six prominent longitudinal ridges, which gives the fruit its distinct star shape when cut crosswise.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to tropical Southeast Asia, the starfruit tree thrives in warm, humid, tropical, and subtropical climates. Today, it is widely cultivated and commonly found growing around the world in regions such as India, southern China, the Philippines, Australia, and in warmer U.S. climates like Florida and Hawaii."

This process severely interferes with kidney function and can rapidly lead to acute kidney injury or fatal renal failure",
