The leaves are dark green, patterned with horizontal gray bands throughout, and may feature a yellow stripe along the margins1. When the plant blooms, it produces many yellow, star-like flowers that grow on a tall central spike or raceme1.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: It is very commonly kept indoors as a houseplant1.
