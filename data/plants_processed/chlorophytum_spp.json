    "description": "Brief Description (Appearance, Habitat, and Where Commonly Found)\n\u2022 Appearance: The Spider Plant is a grass-like, clump-forming perennial characterized by its long, narrow, and gracefully arching leaves. The foliage is typically green and often features striking white or pale yellow stripes running down the center or along the margins. It gets its common name from the small, spider-like baby plantlets (spiderettes) that dangle down from long, wiry stems (runners) after the plant produces tiny, star-shaped white flowers.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: While it is native to the tropical and southern regions of Africa, this plant is incredibly adaptable. Today, it is most commonly found worldwide as a highly popular, low-maintenance indoor houseplant, frequently displayed in hanging baskets or on high shelves where its cascading plantlets can be showcased."
