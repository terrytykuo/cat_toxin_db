      "chemical_formula": "Not provided in the given sources.",
      "description": "in cats: These insoluble crystals are bundled tightly inside specialized plant cells called idioblasts3. When a cat chews or crushes the plant, these cells are mechanically ruptured, which forcefully ejects the sharp, needle-like crystals into the cat's oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract23. This acts as a physical irritant rather than a chemical poison, penetrating the delicate tissues and causing immediate physical trauma, intense burning, pain, and localized swelling (edema) of the mouth, tongue, and throat",
      "concentration_notes": "The insoluble calcium oxalate crystals are found throughout all parts of the Silver Leaf Philodendron15. The overall toxicity is generally considered moderate1. Because biting the plant causes immediate and intense oral pain, cats typically stop chewing it very quickly, which naturally limits the amount they consume and prevents more severe systemic issues"

The insoluble calcium oxalate crystals in Silver Leaf Philodendron can cause intense inflammation and swelling (edema) of the tongue and laryngeal region (pharynx/throat), which can occasionally be severe enough to obstruct the air passages and cause respiratory distress (dyspnea)1....\n2.

      "notes": "Administering dairy is helpful because the calcium binds to the insoluble oxalates, aiding in clearing the irritating crystals from the mouth and esophagus1. Because chewing the plant causes immediate and intense pain, cats rarely consume large amounts, making this simple decontamination step sufficient for many mild exposures1.\n3.

      "notes": "While insoluble oxalates usually only act as localized physical irritants, Philodendron ingestions are uniquely noted to occasionally cause severe systemic complications in cats. The veterinary team may need to provide targeted symptomatic care if the cat develops rare but serious reported side effects, such as excitability, nervous spasms, convulsions, encephalitis, or renal (kidney) failure",
