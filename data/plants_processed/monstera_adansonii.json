It is most famous for its striking, bright green, heart-shaped leaves that develop natural, oval-shaped holes (called fenestrations) as the plant matures, which gives it a resemblance to Swiss cheese.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Native to the dense, humid tropical rainforests of Central and South America, it naturally grows as an epiphyte, using its aerial roots to climb up the trunks of larger trees toward the forest canopy. Today, it is most commonly found cultivated worldwide as a highly popular indoor houseplant, where it is frequently displayed trailing out of hanging baskets or climbing up moss poles."

      "description": "in cats: These microscopic, needle-shaped crystals are bundled together within specialized plant cells known as idioblasts23. When a cat bites or chews on the plant, these cells rupture and forcefully eject the sharp crystals directly into the cat's oral mucosa and surrounding tissues23. This acts as a severe mechanical irritant, causing immediate physical trauma, intense burning and pain, swelling of the mouth and throat, and excessive drooling",
      "concentration_notes": "The toxic crystals are found in all parts of the Swiss Cheese Vine1. The plant's overall toxicity level is considered \"moderate\"1. Because chewing the plant causes such immediate and intense pain, cats are usually deterred from consuming large, life-threatening amounts2. Furthermore, unlike the soluble oxalates found in plants like starfruit or rhubarb, these insoluble crystals are not absorbed systemically into the bloodstream, meaning they do not pose a risk for kidney damage or renal failure"
