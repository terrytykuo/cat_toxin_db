      "description": "in cats: The oxalates act as an immediate and intense physical and chemical irritant5. When a cat bites or chews the plant, it causes an unpleasant burning sensation and irritation in the mouth and throat, leading to excessive drooling, difficulty swallowing, and vomiting3.... If a large enough amount of the toxin is digested and makes its way into the cat's bloodstream, it can travel to the liver and cause severe illness, including liver failure4. (Note: In large grazing animals, soluble oxalates are noted to cause kidney failure16.)",
      "concentration_notes": "The overall toxicity of the plant is generally classified as mild to moderate for cats36. The toxins are present throughout the entire plant, but they are most highly concentrated in the underground structures\u2014specifically the roots, tubers, and rhizomes1.... Fortunately, because the very first bite produces such an immediate and painful burning sensation in the mouth, cats are usually deterred from eating large quantities, making fatal or severe poisonings rare"

      "notes": "The cat will often vomit to rid its stomach of the irritating plant material6. In most cases, these symptoms are relatively mild and naturally clear up within about two days5.

      "notes": "Because begonias contain soluble oxalates, this procedure is indicated if the cat has ingested more than just a small taste or nibble (especially the highly toxic roots or tubers) to prevent the toxins from being absorbed into the bloodstream23.\n3.

      "notes": "This is critical if the cat is refusing water due to throat pain or is suffering from dehydration due to vomiting4. Furthermore, if a large amount of soluble oxalates was ingested, the toxins can bind to the body's calcium and cause a dangerous drop in calcium levels (hypocalcemia); in these severe cases, the vet will also administer intravenous calcium gluconate3.\n4.
