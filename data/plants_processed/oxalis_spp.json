The leaves are typically divided into three triangular or heart-shaped leaflets (trifoliate) that exhibit \"sleep movements,\" folding down at night or during harsh light. They produce delicate, five-petaled flowers that are commonly white, pink, or yellow.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: Oxalis species are highly adaptable and grow in a variety of natural habitats worldwide, including woodlands, meadows, and grassy clearings. They are very commonly cultivated and sold as decorative indoor potted houseplants (especially around St. Patrick's Day) and are also frequently found growing wild as common weeds in outdoor gardens and lawns."

      "description": "in cats: Unlike insoluble oxalates that act as physical irritants in the mouth, soluble oxalates are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream23. Once in the blood, they bind with the body's systemic calcium, resulting in a sudden and dangerous drop in blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia)23. Furthermore, there is a risk that these calcium oxalates will precipitate (form solid crystals) within the kidneys, causing damage to the renal tubules and potentially leading to acute renal failure",
      "concentration_notes": "Soluble oxalates are present in varying degrees in all parts of the Shamrock plant3. The toxicity is highly dependent on the amount consumed; a small taste or nibble typically only results in mild gastrointestinal upset (such as vomiting or inappetence)2. A cat must consume a large quantity of the plant to experience the severe systemic effects of hypocalcemia or renal failure"
