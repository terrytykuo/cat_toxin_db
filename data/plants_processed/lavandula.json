This deficiency prevents the cat's body from processing the compound, leading to a buildup of toxins in their system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Systemic Absorption: Linalool can be rapidly absorbed through the skin, by inhalation, or via ingestion.

Consequently, essential oils pose a much higher risk of severe toxicity, including liver failure, compared to the mild gastrointestinal upset typically caused by nibbling the plant. Even passive inhalation from a diffuser can cause respiratory symptoms like coughing or wheezing."

The concentrated nature of the oils means that even small exposures (oral, dermal, or respiratory) can lead to serious health issues, whereas the plant itself generally causes milder symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea."
