This inhibition causes an accumulation of intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium, which subsequently triggers a rise in intracellular calcium3. This cellular disruption forces the cardiac muscle to contract more forcefully but at a slower rate, resulting in severe abnormal heart rates and rhythms34. Ingestion can also trigger a cascade of other severe issues, including vomiting, diarrhea, generalized weakness, breathing difficulties, neurological signs, and potential damage to the liver or kidneys",

Plants containing cardiac glycosides are considered to be among the most toxic plants and have a very \"narrow margin of safety\"1. All parts of the milkweed plant, including its sap, are considered toxic"
