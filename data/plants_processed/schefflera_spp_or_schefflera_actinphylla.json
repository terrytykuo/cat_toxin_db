It is named for its glossy, palmately compound leaves that hang and spread outward, giving it the appearance of an umbrella1. As the plant matures, the number of leaflets increases and they become more compact1. The leaves feature pronounced veins and have edges that are smooth (entire) to slightly scalloped (crenate)1.\n\u2022 Habitat and Where Commonly Found: While its natural outdoor habitat is not detailed in the text, it is very commonly found indoors cultivated as an ornamental houseplant"

      "chemical_formula": "Not provided in the given sources.",
      "description": "in cats: These insoluble oxalate crystals are bundled tightly inside specialized plant cells called idioblasts3. When a cat chews or crushes the plant material, these cells are mechanically ruptured, forcefully ejecting the sharp, needle-like crystals into the cat's tissues3. This acts as a physical irritant rather than a chemical poison, penetrating the delicate mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract13. This immediate physical trauma causes intense localized pain, swelling (edema), excessive drooling, and vomiting",
      "concentration_notes": "The oxalate crystals are found in the leaves of the plant1. Because chewing the plant causes immediate and intense oral pain, cats typically stop eating it very quickly, which naturally limits the amount consumed and keeps the overall toxicity relatively mild3. Unlike soluble oxalates, the insoluble oxalates found in the Umbrella Tree do not absorb into the bloodstream and therefore do not pose a risk of systemic organ damage or acute renal (kidney) injury"
