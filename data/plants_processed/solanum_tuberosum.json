This particularly damages the epithelial cells of the intestines, leading to severe gastrointestinal irritation and inflammation2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase: Solanine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine3. This causes an overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to neurological symptoms, muscle tremors, excessive salivation, and a abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia)3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Impairment of Mitochondrial Function: These toxins disrupt the energy balance of the cells by inhibiting the respiratory chain, which results in weakness, lethargy, and central nervous system (CNS) depression",
      "concentration_notes": "\u25e6 Concentration: The toxins are highly concentrated in the green tubers, the sprouts (eyes), and the peels of the potato5. Conversely, cooked, peeled potatoes contain only trace amounts of the toxins and are considered tolerable for pets in moderation5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Feline Sensitivity: Cats are notably more sensitive to solanine than dogs67. Because cats lack a specific liver detoxification process called glucuronidation, their bodies break down the toxin much slower, meaning even small amounts of raw or green potatoes can cause severe and prolonged illness"
