While sources note that dogs have a high density of these receptors (making them very sensitive), cats are also susceptible to these neurochemical changes, which lead to the clinical signs of intoxication12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Lipid Solubility: THC is highly lipid-soluble (dissolves in fats), meaning it is easily stored in the fatty tissues of the liver, brain, and kidneys, which can prolong its elimination from the body3.\n4.
