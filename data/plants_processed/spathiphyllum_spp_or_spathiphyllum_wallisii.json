      "name": "Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, specifically in a needle-like form known as raphides",
      "chemical_formula": "Not provided in the given sources.",
      "description": "in cats: The needle-like oxalate crystals are bundled and stored inside specialized plant cells called idioblasts4. When a cat bites, chews, or crushes the plant material, these idioblasts rupture and shoot the sharp raphides into the surrounding tissues4. The crystals act as tiny needles that physically pierce and traumatize the oral cavity and gastrointestinal mucous membranes34. This mechanical irritation causes immediate, intense burning and pain in the mouth and throat, leading to excessive drooling, pawing at the mouth, tissue swelling (edema), and vomiting2.... Importantly, because the Peace Lily is an \"imposter lily,\" this mechanism only causes localized oral and gastrointestinal distress, rather than the systemic, fatal kidney failure caused by true lilies",
      "concentration_notes": "The overall toxicity of the Peace Lily is considered mild to moderate12. The insoluble calcium oxalate crystals are found throughout all parts of the plant, with raphides notably present within the foliage26. Because chewing the plant causes immediate and intense pain, cats usually stop eating it right away; this naturally limits the amount of the plant they consume, making severe poisoning rare and the prognosis for a full recovery excellent"

      "notes": "While generally rare and usually easily treatable, if the edema (swelling) spreads to the laryngeal region (the throat/airway), it can obstruct the airway and cause potentially life-threatening respiratory distress46.

      "notes": "Veterinarians (or owners at home, if instructed) may offer the cat milk or other calcium-containing dairy products. The insoluble oxalates bind directly to the calcium in the dairy, which helps clear the crystals from the mouth and esophagus and soothes the intense burning sensation3.\n3.
