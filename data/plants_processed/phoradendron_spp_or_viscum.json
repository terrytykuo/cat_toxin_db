When ingested, they can cause profuse vomiting and diarrhea, dilated pupils, and rapid, labored breathing2. Systemically, they affect the heart, causing a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure, which can ultimately lead to shock and death from cardiovascular collapse",
      "concentration_notes": "These toxins are found in all parts of the plant, though the leaves are considered to be more toxic than the berries14. While severe mistletoe toxicity is uncommon and usually requires a cat to eat a large amount of the plant, small ingestions are still potent enough to cause mild to severe stomach upset"

      "description": "in cats: Working alongside the lectins, phoratoxins specifically target the heart muscle and cardiovascular system13. They are responsible for inducing dangerous drops in blood pressure (hypotension) and abnormally slow heart rates (bradycardia), which can lead to profound weakness and odd behavior",

However, ingesting larger amounts leads to severe gastrointestinal distress56. Additionally, many store-bought mistletoe decorations use plastic berries; if a cat ingests a large amount of these fake berries, it can cause a physical gastrointestinal obstruction4.\n2.

After vomiting, they will administer activated charcoal to bind to any remaining toxins in the digestive tract and prevent them from being absorbed into the bloodstream.",

If the cat's heart rate drops dangerously low (bradycardia), the vet will administer specific cardiovascular drugs, such as atropine, to stabilize the heart rate.",
      "notes": "This targeted treatment is necessary because the phoratoxins in mistletoe directly depress the cardiovascular system. Cats that have ingested a large amount of the plant are at the highest risk for requiring emergency heart stabilization.\n4. Symptomatic and Supportive Care",
