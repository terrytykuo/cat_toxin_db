The plant produces distinct white berries that each contain a single seed1.\n\u2022 Habitat and Common Locations: In its natural habitat, mistletoe grows as a perennial parasitic plant that attaches itself to deciduous trees1. It is most commonly found inside homes during the winter months, as it is a very popular festive decoration brought indoors for the Christmas holiday season"

When ingested, they can cause profuse vomiting and diarrhea, dilated pupils, and rapid, labored breathing2. Systemically, they affect the heart, causing a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure, which can ultimately lead to shock and death from cardiovascular collapse",
      "concentration_notes": "These toxins are found in all parts of the plant, though the leaves are considered to be more toxic than the berries14. While severe mistletoe toxicity is uncommon and usually requires a cat to eat a large amount of the plant, small ingestions are still potent enough to cause mild to severe stomach upset"
