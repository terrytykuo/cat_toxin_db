Because a cat's body cannot properly metabolize them, the oils act as severe irritants to the gastrointestinal tract, causing vomiting and diarrhea4. If absorbed in larger amounts or inhaled, these volatile oils can depress the central nervous system, cause respiratory distress, and place dangerous stress on the liver, potentially leading to liver damage",
      "concentration_notes": "The level of danger is directly tied to the concentration of these oils. Nibbling on fresh Orange Mint leaves generally results in mild stomach upset or irritation78. However, highly concentrated forms, such as extracted mint essential oils, are exceptionally potent and dangerous. Exposure to concentrated oils\u2014whether ingested, inhaled from a diffuser, or absorbed through the skin\u2014can quickly cause severe, life-threatening toxicity and neurological issues"

Following the removal of stomach contents, the vet may administer activated charcoal to bind to and absorb any remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract",
