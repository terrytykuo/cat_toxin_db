When a cat bites or chews the plant, the mechanical action ruptures these cells, forcefully ejecting the sharp crystals into the cat's oral mucosa and surrounding tissues12. This physical trauma causes immediate and intense pain, burning, and inflammation of the mouth, lips, and tongue13. While the primary mechanism is physical irritation, the sources note that in cats, ingestion can occasionally lead to systemic issues like renal failure, excitability, nervous spasms, convulsions, and encephalitis",

      "notes": "Veterinarians may also utilize milk, yogurt, or other calcium-containing dairy products to flush the mouth23.
