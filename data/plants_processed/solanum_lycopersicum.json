This causes significant damage to the intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in severe gastrointestinal inflammation and irritation5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Neurological Overstimulation: The toxins inhibit acetylcholinesterase, a crucial enzyme in the brain responsible for breaking down acetylcholine6. This inhibition leads to a dangerous overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25e6 Mitochondrial Impairment: The glycoalkaloids disrupt the energy balance of the cells by inhibiting the cellular respiratory chain",
      "concentration_notes": "The concentration of these toxins is exceptionally high in the green, vegetative parts of the plant (leaves and stems) as well as in the unripe, green fruit1.... As the tomato ripens and turns red, the toxin levels drop significantly to negligible amounts; ripe red tomatoes are largely harmless to cats, though consuming them in large quantities may still cause mild irritation1.... Furthermore, cats are much more sensitive to these toxins than dogs because feline livers lack the specific glucuronidation pathways needed to efficiently detoxify them, leading to prolonged and more severe poisoning"
